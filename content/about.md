I am [Nikhil Rayaprolu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhilrayaprolu/) an independent researcher on Sanathana Dharma. This site aims to gather and organize resources to support parents and educators exploring alternative education methods.

My journey is an ongoing exploration of the true essence of education and its connection to life. This inquiry naturally lead to a need to understand Bharatiya culture, history, and social fabric and it's way to live the eternal truth.

We are seeking contributors to join us on this path. If you are passionate about contributing and engaging in meaningful discussions, please contact me at nikhil684@gmail.com.

We are a small team currently and we may coordinate with each other through Whatsapp or any of your preferred medium of communication.

I would like to see more faces on this About page soon.


Personally, I  have a diverse background as computer science graduate, open-source contributor, nature lover, cofounding a startup and failing at it, travelling, machine learning researcher, and teacher at J Krishnamurti School. Additionally, I delve into the exploration of Advaita philosophy, practice Non-Doing and Kriya Yoga. Currently, I divide my time between spending quality moments with my cousins, working on personal projects, and my spiritual time.
