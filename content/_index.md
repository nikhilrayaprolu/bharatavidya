Growing up in India today can be quite perplexing. Traditional forms of culture and religion are being challenged by influences from global media. If children are not introduced to their religious culture at a young age, it will be difficult for them to absorb the values of their rich cultural heritage and folklore. Whether or not children actively live the culture, it is important they understand its background to prevent alienation from their roots or the community they identify with.

We are fortunate to have the extensive works of the Rishis, including the stories of the Panchatantra, the Puranas, the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, the Vedas, and the Bhagavad Gita, as well as the cultural framework of the structured Purusharthas.

To nurture this innate inclination towards right values, we have created this website as a guide for educators and parents on how to impart Bharata Vidya to their children.
