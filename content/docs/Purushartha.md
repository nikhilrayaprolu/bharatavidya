## Introduction

The concept of "Human Goals" translates into Sanskrit as "Purushartha." This term combines two words: "Purusha," meaning human, and "Artha," which, in this context, means goal. Thus, Purushartha signifies the goals or purposes of human life.

The four primary goals of human existence, known as Purusharthas, are:

1. **Artha (Security)**
2. **Kama (Pleasure)**
3. **Dharma (Ethics)**
4. **Moksha (Liberation)**

These goals are divided into two categories. The first category, Artha and Kama, is pursued by all living beings. The second category, Dharma and Moksha, is unique to humans. The term "Purusha" emphasizes that these four goals collectively define the human experience, setting us apart from animals and plants.

### The Four Human Goals

#### The Reason for Purushartha in Humans

Humans, like other living beings, seek food, rest, security, and reproduction. However, what differentiates humans is the faculty of intellect (Buddhi). This faculty allows for judgment, reasoning, planning, and reflection, enabling humans to contemplate their existence and set goals beyond mere survival.

This intellectual capacity also has a downside, making us self-conscious and self-judgmental, leading to feelings of inferiority or superiority. This self-awareness drives us to improve our future, planning and striving for more than just basic needs. Unlike animals, which act on instinct alone, humans exercise free will and choice, leading to the pursuit of Purusharthas.

### 1. Artha – The Endless Search for Security

Artha encompasses all forms of security in life: wealth, power, influence, and fame. While animals seek security through instinctual behaviors like hoarding food, human pursuit of security is unending. No matter how much wealth or power we accumulate, the sense of inadequacy persists, leading to a continuous struggle for more.

### 2. Kama – The Mercurial Nature of Pleasure

Kama refers to all forms of sensual pleasure, such as food, travel, sex, and music. After achieving a sense of security, humans pursue pleasure based on personal likes and dislikes. Unlike animals, whose pleasure-seeking is guided by instinct, human desires are complex and influenced by individual value systems.

Our desires are ever-changing and subjective, leading to a constant shift in what we find pleasurable. This shifting nature of desires keeps us in a perpetual struggle to obtain what we find enjoyable and avoid what we find displeasurable.

### 3. Dharma – Ethics

Dharma is an invisible form of wealth, manifesting as good fortune or luck, contributing to our well-being. It is rooted in ethical behavior, as prescribed in the Vedas, which outline the do's and don'ts that lead to merit (Punya) or demerit (Papa). Good actions aligned with Dharma result in Punya, bringing positive experiences, while bad actions result in Papa, leading to negative experiences. Thus, Dharma governs the pursuit of security (Artha) and pleasure (Kama), ensuring ethical standards are maintained.

### 4. Moksha – Liberation or Freedom

Moksha, or liberation, is unique to humans and pursued by those who recognize the limitations of Artha, Kama, and Dharma. It signifies freedom from all binding desires and the sense of insecurity. Moksha is about inner freedom, self-mastery, and detachment from the endless pursuits of security, pleasure, and ethical merit. It is the ultimate goal, leading to a state of being where one is unaffected by the presence or absence of material or sensual comforts.

In conclusion, while the first three goals (Artha, Kama, Dharma) address the needs and desires that drive human behavior, Moksha represents the ultimate liberation from these pursuits, leading to true inner peace and freedom.
