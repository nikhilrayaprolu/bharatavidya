## Introduction

The concept of "Human Goals" translates into Sanskrit as "Purushartha." This term combines two words: "Purusha," meaning human, and "Artha," which, in this context, means goal. Thus, Purushartha signifies the goals or purposes of human life.

The four primary goals of human existence, known as Purusharthas, are:

1. **Artha** is the pursuit of wealth and material success.
2. **Kama** is the pursuit of pleasure and sensory enjoyment.
3. **Dharma** is the pursuit of righteousness and moral duty.
4. **Moksha** is the pursuit of ultimate inner freedom and liberation from all binding desires and attachments.

These goals are divided into two categories. The first category, Artha and Kama, is pursued by all living beings. The second category, Dharma and Moksha, is unique to humans. The term "Purusha" emphasizes that these four goals collectively define the human experience, setting us apart from animals and plants.

### The Four Human Goals

#### The Reason for Purushartha in Humans

Humans, like other living beings, seek food, rest, security, and reproduction. However, what differentiates humans is the faculty of intellect (Buddhi). This faculty allows for judgment, reasoning, planning, and reflection, enabling humans to contemplate their existence and set goals beyond mere survival.

This intellectual capacity also has a downside, making us self-conscious and self-judgmental, leading to feelings of inferiority or superiority. This self-awareness drives us to improve our future, planning and striving for more than just basic needs. Unlike animals, which act on instinct alone, humans exercise free will and choice, leading to the pursuit of Purusharthas.

### 1. Artha – The Endless Search for Security

Artha encompasses all forms of security in life: wealth, power, influence, and fame. While animals seek security through instinctual behaviors like hoarding food, human pursuit of security is unending. No matter how much wealth or power we accumulate, the sense of inadequacy persists, leading to a continuous struggle for more.

### 2. Kama – The Mercurial Nature of Pleasure

Kama refers to all forms of sensual pleasure, such as food, travel, sex, and music. After achieving a sense of security, humans pursue pleasure based on personal likes and dislikes. Unlike animals, whose pleasure-seeking is guided by instinct, human desires are complex and influenced by individual value systems.

Our desires are ever-changing and subjective, leading to a constant shift in what we find pleasurable. This shifting nature of desires keeps us in a perpetual struggle to obtain what we find enjoyable and avoid what we find displeasurable.

### 3. Dharma – Ethics


#### The Multiple Meanings of Dharma

The term "Dharma" carries various meanings based on its context, such as conduct, duty, justice, virtue, morality, religion, and more. Despite similarities with terms like law (Torah), reason (Logos), way (Christianity), and path (Tao), none encapsulates the full essence of Dharma as understood in Sanskrit. Derived from the root "dhri," Dharma means "that which upholds" or "that which maintains stability and harmony in the universe." It represents the natural order, encompassing the innate behavior of all entities, from electrons to galaxies, plants, animals, and humans.

Human understanding of the Dharma of inanimate objects is what we call physics. Unlike religion, which is specific to humans, Dharma applies universally, guiding all aspects of life towards harmony and stability.

#### Dharma for Humans

Human pursuits are categorized into four goals: Artha (security), Kama (pleasures), Dharma (ethics), and Moksha (liberation). Unlike animals, whose actions are instinctually driven, humans must choose their ends and means ethically. Ethical standards, grounded in common sense, dictate permissible actions and means. This need for ethical conduct arises from humans' unique faculty of choice, making it essential to align desires for security and pleasure with ethical norms.

### The Source of Ethics

Ethical values stem from a common-sense appreciation of mutual respect and fairness. For instance, non-deception becomes a value because we do not want to be deceived. These commonsense ethics form the basis of Dharma, further enriched by religious ethics which add accountability beyond human laws. Good actions yield positive experiences (Punya), while bad actions result in negative consequences (Papa).

### The Universality of Dharma

Dharma, sensed universally like gravitational force, exists inherently. Conforming to Dharma aligns us with the divine order (Isvara), promoting harmony and well-being.

### The Five Types of Dharma

#### 1. Svadharma – Your Relative Nature

Svadharma refers to one's personal nature or role within the larger cosmic program. Each person has a unique nature influencing their choices and actions. Acting in harmony with this nature ensures mental peace and facilitates spiritual inquiry.

#### 2. Samanya Dharma – Universal Values

Samanya Dharma encompasses universal moral values derived from the principle of non-injury, such as honesty, non-theft, and mutual respect. These values are innate and their violation results in personal and societal harm.

#### 3. Visesa Dharma – Situational Ethics

Life often presents complex situations requiring interpretation of universal values. Visesa Dharma involves situational ethics, where actions are judged based on specific circumstances, like the necessity of a white lie to prevent harm.

#### 4. Ordinary Dharma – Everyday Dharma

Daily life involves various social, political, economic, and legal Dharmas. Abiding by these promotes general well-being, though sometimes they may conflict with one's Svadharma, requiring thoughtful consideration.

#### 5. Body Dharma

The physical body has its own Dharma, necessitating actions that maintain health and avoid harm. Scripture advises against detrimental habits and encourages those promoting well-being.
### 4. Moksha – Liberation or Freedom


Moksha, like Dharma, is a pursuit unique to humans. Unlike Dharma, however, Moksha is followed by only a few who recognize the deeper longing for freedom from all "binding" desires and the pervasive sense of insecurity that characterizes much of human experience. Moksha represents inner freedom, liberation from the attachments to Dharma (righteous living), Artha (wealth), and Kama (pleasure).

#### Understanding the Pursuits: Dharma, Artha, and Kama

The pursuits of Dharma, Artha, and Kama are driven by the underlying belief that "I am insecure, I am unhappy, I am mortal, and I must become somebody." As individuals, we often feel limited and seek to overcome this sense of limitation by striving to be bigger and better through these three pursuits. 

The relentless chase after these goals stems from an inherent urge to transcend our perceived limitations.

#### The Futility of Accumulation

How can this urge be satisfied? The simple answer many believe in is by acquiring more Dharma, Artha, and Kama. However, adding more to these pursuits does not fundamentally alter the basic sense of limitation that pervades our existence.

To illustrate this point, scriptures use the metaphor of a broomstick. Imagine tying a silk string around a broomstick, followed by a silver string, a golden string, and finally, a diamond necklace. Despite the adornments, it remains a broomstick. No matter how much it is decorated, its essential nature does not change. Similarly, no amount of Dharma, Artha, or Kama can change the fundamental sense of limitation that we feel.

#### The Nature of Enslavement

Enslavement to objects and desires can occur in two primary ways:

1. **Absence of the Desired Object**: When we desire something but do not possess it, its absence creates a sense of limitation, emptiness, and incompleteness. We become obsessed with its absence.
2. **Presence of the Desired Object**: Conversely, the presence of certain objects or people can also enslave us by creating stress and tension. For instance, money can create problems both through its scarcity and abundance.

#### Moksha: The Ultimate Human Goal

This attachment and aversion to external objects constitute bondage. Moksha is freedom from this bondage, representing self-mastery and inner strength. When we achieve Moksha, we no longer feel limited by the absence of objects, nor do we feel strained by their presence. Moksha means being at peace, whether we possess Dharma, Artha, and Kama or not. 

The first three pursuits (Dharma, Artha, Kama) are secondary goals, perpetuating a cycle of slavery to our desires and insecurities. Moksha, on the other hand, is the primary goal of human life. It is only through Moksha that one can attain true freedom and no longer be a slave to anything.

In essence, Moksha is not just freedom from external attachments but also the realization of one's inner completeness and wholeness. It is the ultimate state of inner maturity and mastery, where one is entirely self-sufficient and liberated from the perpetual cycle of desire and dissatisfaction.
