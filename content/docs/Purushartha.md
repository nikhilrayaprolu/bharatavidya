## Introduction

The concept of "Human Goals" translates into Sanskrit as "Purushartha." This term combines two words: "Purusha," meaning human, and "Artha," which, in this context, means goal. Thus, Purushartha signifies the goals or purposes of human life.

The four primary goals of human existence, known as Purusharthas, are:

1. **Artha** is the pursuit of wealth and material success.
2. **Kama** is the pursuit of pleasure and sensory enjoyment.
3. **Dharma** is the pursuit of righteousness and moral duty.
4. **Moksha** is the pursuit of ultimate inner freedom and liberation from all binding desires and attachments.

These goals are divided into two categories. The first category, Artha and Kama, is pursued by all living beings. The second category, Dharma and Moksha, is unique to humans. The term "Purusha" emphasizes that these four goals collectively define the human experience, setting us apart from animals and plants.

### The Four Human Goals

#### The Reason for Purushartha in Humans

Humans, like other living beings, seek food, rest, security, and reproduction. However, what differentiates humans is the faculty of intellect (Buddhi). This faculty allows for judgment, reasoning, planning, and reflection, enabling humans to contemplate their existence and set goals beyond mere survival.

This intellectual capacity also has a downside, making us self-conscious and self-judgmental, leading to feelings of inferiority or superiority. This self-awareness drives us to improve our future, planning and striving for more than just basic needs. Unlike animals, which act on instinct alone, humans exercise free will and choice, leading to the pursuit of Purusharthas.

### 1. Artha – The Endless Search for Security

Artha encompasses all forms of security in life: wealth, power, influence, and fame. While animals seek security through instinctual behaviors like hoarding food, human pursuit of security is unending. No matter how much wealth or power we accumulate, the sense of inadequacy persists, leading to a continuous struggle for more.

### 2. Kama – The Mercurial Nature of Pleasure

Kama refers to all forms of sensual pleasure, such as food, travel, sex, and music. After achieving a sense of security, humans pursue pleasure based on personal likes and dislikes. Unlike animals, whose pleasure-seeking is guided by instinct, human desires are complex and influenced by individual value systems.

Our desires are ever-changing and subjective, leading to a constant shift in what we find pleasurable. This shifting nature of desires keeps us in a perpetual struggle to obtain what we find enjoyable and avoid what we find displeasurable.

### 3. Dharma – Ethics


#### The Multiple Meanings of Dharma

The term "Dharma" carries various meanings based on its context, such as conduct, duty, justice, virtue, morality, religion, and more. Despite similarities with terms like law (Torah), reason (Logos), way (Christianity), and path (Tao), none encapsulates the full essence of Dharma as understood in Sanskrit. Derived from the root "dhri," Dharma means "that which upholds" or "that which maintains stability and harmony in the universe." It represents the natural order, encompassing the innate behavior of all entities, from electrons to galaxies, plants, animals, and humans.

Human understanding of the Dharma of inanimate objects is what we call physics. Unlike religion, which is specific to humans, Dharma applies universally, guiding all aspects of life towards harmony and stability.

#### Dharma for Humans

Human pursuits are categorized into four goals: Artha (security), Kama (pleasures), Dharma (ethics), and Moksha (liberation). Unlike animals, whose actions are instinctually driven, humans must choose their ends and means ethically. Ethical standards, grounded in common sense, dictate permissible actions and means. This need for ethical conduct arises from humans' unique faculty of choice, making it essential to align desires for security and pleasure with ethical norms.

### The Source of Ethics

Ethical values stem from a common-sense appreciation of mutual respect and fairness. For instance, non-deception becomes a value because we do not want to be deceived. These commonsense ethics form the basis of Dharma, further enriched by religious ethics which add accountability beyond human laws. Good actions yield positive experiences (Punya), while bad actions result in negative consequences (Papa).

### The Universality of Dharma

Dharma, sensed universally like gravitational force, exists inherently. Conforming to Dharma aligns us with the divine order (Isvara), promoting harmony and well-being.

### The Five Types of Dharma

#### 1. Svadharma – Your Relative Nature

Svadharma refers to one's personal nature or role within the larger cosmic program. Each person has a unique nature influencing their choices and actions. Acting in harmony with this nature ensures mental peace and facilitates spiritual inquiry.

#### 2. Samanya Dharma – Universal Values

Samanya Dharma encompasses universal moral values derived from the principle of non-injury, such as honesty, non-theft, and mutual respect. These values are innate and their violation results in personal and societal harm.

#### 3. Visesa Dharma – Situational Ethics

Life often presents complex situations requiring interpretation of universal values. Visesa Dharma involves situational ethics, where actions are judged based on specific circumstances, like the necessity of a white lie to prevent harm.

#### 4. Ordinary Dharma – Everyday Dharma

Daily life involves various social, political, economic, and legal Dharmas. Abiding by these promotes general well-being, though sometimes they may conflict with one's Svadharma, requiring thoughtful consideration.

#### 5. Body Dharma

The physical body has its own Dharma, necessitating actions that maintain health and avoid harm. Scripture advises against detrimental habits and encourages those promoting well-being.
### 4. Moksha – Liberation or Freedom


Moksha, like Dharma, is a pursuit unique to humans. Unlike Dharma, however, Moksha is followed by only a few who recognize the deeper longing for freedom from all "binding" desires and the pervasive sense of insecurity that characterizes much of human experience. Moksha represents inner freedom, liberation from the attachments to Dharma (righteous living), Artha (wealth), and Kama (pleasure).

#### Understanding the Pursuits: Dharma, Artha, and Kama

The pursuits of Dharma, Artha, and Kama are driven by the underlying belief that "I am insecure, I am unhappy, I am mortal, and I must become somebody." As individuals, we often feel limited and seek to overcome this sense of limitation by striving to be bigger and better through these three pursuits. 

The relentless chase after these goals stems from an inherent urge to transcend our perceived limitations.

#### The Futility of Accumulation

How can this urge be satisfied? The simple answer many believe in is by acquiring more Dharma, Artha, and Kama. However, adding more to these pursuits does not fundamentally alter the basic sense of limitation that pervades our existence.

To illustrate this point, scriptures use the metaphor of a broomstick. Imagine tying a silk string around a broomstick, followed by a silver string, a golden string, and finally, a diamond necklace. Despite the adornments, it remains a broomstick. No matter how much it is decorated, its essential nature does not change. Similarly, no amount of Dharma, Artha, or Kama can change the fundamental sense of limitation that we feel.

#### The Nature of Enslavement

Enslavement to objects and desires can occur in two primary ways:

1. **Absence of the Desired Object**: When we desire something but do not possess it, its absence creates a sense of limitation, emptiness, and incompleteness. We become obsessed with its absence.
2. **Presence of the Desired Object**: Conversely, the presence of certain objects or people can also enslave us by creating stress and tension. For instance, money can create problems both through its scarcity and abundance.

#### Moksha: The Ultimate Human Goal

This attachment and aversion to external objects constitute bondage. Moksha is freedom from this bondage, representing self-mastery and inner strength. When we achieve Moksha, we no longer feel limited by the absence of objects, nor do we feel strained by their presence. Moksha means being at peace, whether we possess Dharma, Artha, and Kama or not. 

The first three pursuits (Dharma, Artha, Kama) are secondary goals, perpetuating a cycle of slavery to our desires and insecurities. Moksha, on the other hand, is the primary goal of human life. It is only through Moksha that one can attain true freedom and no longer be a slave to anything.

In essence, Moksha is not just freedom from external attachments but also the realization of one's inner completeness and wholeness. It is the ultimate state of inner maturity and mastery, where one is entirely self-sufficient and liberated from the perpetual cycle of desire and dissatisfaction.

### The Ultimate Pursuit: A Vedantic Interpretation of Human Endeavors

In the modern world, where the race for material success often eclipses deeper existential quests, the concept of self-actualization frequently appears as a distant, almost mystical goal. However, an exploration through the lens of Vedantic philosophy reveals a profound truth: every human endeavor, whether overtly mundane or grandiose, is a veiled pursuit of moksha—freedom from the illusions of limitation and insecurity. 

### The Fallacy of Hierarchical Pursuits

Modern psychological theories, such as Maslow's hierarchy of needs, offer a compelling yet simplistic map of human motivation. Maslow's pyramid suggests a sequential progression from basic physiological needs (ahara) through safety (artha), love and belonging, esteem (kama), culminating in self-actualization. This model presents an enticing structure but overlooks the inherent unity and deeper purpose behind these pursuits.

In Vedantic thought, moksha doesn’t merely sit atop a pyramid—it is the foundational drive of all human actions. From seeking nourishment to striving for social esteem, every act is inherently a movement toward liberation. This understanding revolutionizes our perception of human motives and aspirations.

### Moksha: The Substrate of Every Aspiration

Even our most instinctive drives are infused with the quest for moksha. We might eat primarily to sustain our bodies, but the underlying purpose is far deeper. Maintaining the body is ultimately an effort to fulfill our profound spiritual yearning for union with our limitless essence.

Consider our societal pursuits for status and esteem. The desire to be respected, to attain prominence, stems from a fundamental need to feel complete, to transcend our perceived limitations and feeling of incompleteness and dissatisfaction. We believe that social validation will grant us the freedom (moksha) from this sense of limitation. Similarly, our quests for financial security (artha) and fulfillment of desires (kama) are not ends in themselves but our search and trials in the journey to find permanent fulfilment.

### The Illusion of Temporary Fulfillment

In the kaleidoscope of human activity, we frequently confuse temporary achievements with the attainment of permanent fulfilment. Material success, relationships, and social status often appear as proxies for our deeper spiritual fulfillment. However, this is an illusion. True moksha lies beyond these transient milestones.

Why do we amass wealth or chase after fleeting pleasures? At their core, these activities are misguided attempts to achieve the sense of freedom and completeness that only moksha can provide. Recognizing this transforms how we approach our goals and aspirations.

### Reframing the Hierarchy of Needs

Redefining Maslow’s hierarchy from a Vedantic perspective, moksha emerges not as the final stage but as the underlying impetus of all human endeavors. Picture the pyramid not as a sequential structure but as a circle with moksha at its center. Every point on the circle, whether a need for food, security, love, or esteem, radiates from and loops back to this central pursuit of liberation.

This paradigm shift allows us to see that every action, every craving, and every achievement is ultimately directed towards realizing our ever-free nature. Whether we are aware of it or not, the essence of our pursuits is the same.

### The Perennial Pursuit

In truth, every moment of our existence is an attempt to align with our true, unlimited self. Waking up in the morning, engaging in conversations, striving for career advancements, and even watching a movie—these are all steps on the path to realizing moksha albeit experiments with temporary fulfilments until the yearning for permanent fulfilment becomes stronger. The profound drive for liberation permeates every aspect of our lives.

### Conclusion: The Path to Rediscovery

Understanding that all human pursuits are essentially directed towards moksha transforms our approach to life. It reveals that beneath our desires (kama) and quests for security (artha) lies our innate journey towards ultimate freedom.

In this reimagined framework, we recognize that the purpose of every endeavor, no matter how trivial or exalted, is to free ourselves from the illusions of limitation and to awaken to our inherent boundless nature. All roads, varied as they may be, lead to the same destination: the unshackling of the soul, the realization of our ever-existent, ever-free essence.

This Vedantic interpretation transcends Maslow’s hierarchy, offering a holistic vision that every pursuit, whether for survival or esteem, is intrinsically a quest for moksha—the ultimate liberation.

### Difference between Purushartha (Bharata) and Maslow Hierarchy of Needs (Modernity)

Western psychological theories have long dominated the fields of sociology, psychology, and management, offering frameworks for understanding human motivation. Yet, nestled within the ancient texts of Indian philosophy lies a holistic approach to human life that reverberates with profound wisdom. This approach is articulated through the concept of Puruṣārtha (पुरुषार्थ), which translates to the 'purpose of man.' Rooted in the Vedas and first encountered in the Dharmaśāstras, Puruṣārtha provides a four-pronged compass — Dharma (righteousness, duty), Artha (prosperity, political order), Kama (love, pleasure, psychological values), and Moksha (liberation/salvation). These pillars offer a comprehensive guide for living a balanced and meaningful life.

#### The Foundations of Puruṣārtha

Puruṣārtha blends seamlessly into the fabric of one's existence, integrating naturally into various life stages and scenarios. Dharma serves as the pivot around which all other objectives revolve, emphasizing the importance of moral behavior and duty. Artha and Kama, though essential, are to be pursued in moderation, ensuring that earthly desires and material pursuits do not overshadow morality and duty. Finally, Moksha stands as the ultimate goal, liberating the soul from the cycle of birth and rebirth.

This sacred quartet is designed to harmonize individual needs with collective welfare, fostering a society where personal actions contribute positively to the common good. The inherent flexibility of these principles allows for diverging interpretations and priorities, mirroring the nuanced nature of human existence.

#### A Comparative Lens: Maslow and Puruṣārtha

When juxtaposing Puruṣārtha with Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, fascinating parallels and contrasts emerge. Maslow’s pyramid, introduced in 1943 through “A Theory of Human Motivation,” charts the progression of human needs: Physiological, Safety, Love, Esteem, and Self-actualization. Unlike Puruṣārtha, Maslow's theory lacks a foundational moral principle guiding these needs. While Maslow emphasizes gratification and external achievements, Puruṣārtha interweaves satisfaction with moral and spiritual growth, culminating in Moksha.

Puruṣārtha inherently encourages self-awareness and harmony with the universe, principles conspicuously absent in Maslow’s structure. The Indian ethos stresses self-motivation and internal contentment over external validation, contrasting sharply with Maslow's progression through levels based on fulfilled needs.

#### Dharma: The Ethical Compass

Dharma, often misunderstood or inadequately translated into English, transcends mere righteousness. According to The Oxford Dictionary of World Religions, Dharma signifies the universal order and customs that sustain life and the cosmos. It dictates harmonious living, balancing individual desires with responsibilities towards society and nature.

Disregarding dharma invites chaos and suffering, perpetuating the individual's cycle of rebirth. This belief underscores the essential role of Dharma as a stabilizing force, a stark contrast to the self-centered pursuit of needs in Maslow’s hierarchy.

#### Bridging the Philosophical Divide

The pursuit of Artha (wealth and prosperity) and Kama (desire and pleasure) is critical for personal development and societal contribution. However, it is the moderation of these pursuits through Dharma that ensures a well-rounded, ethical life. Historical texts like the Kamasutra and the Arthashastra echo this sentiment, acknowledging the dangers of excess and advocating for balanced living.

Maslow barely touches the spiritual dimension with his concept of Self-actualization — reaching one's full potential — which remains focused on individual capability rather than collective harmony. His later development of "Metamotivation" introduced elements akin to Eastern philosophies, marking a shift towards integrating spiritual and transcendent experiences.

#### The Collective Versus the Individual

Indian philosophy traditionally values collectivism, embedding personal goals within communal welfare. The modern trend towards individual rights and external validation starkly contrasts with this view. Globalization and urbanization have diluted the collectivist ethos, accentuating materialism and leading society to a cultural crossroad.

Revisiting the principles of Puruṣārtha offers a roadmap back to balanced living. Echoing Ved Vyasa’s wisdom in the Mahabharata, the pursuit of Dharma organically paves the way for Artha and Kama, challenging contemporary society to realign its priorities.

#### Conclusion

As technological and economic advancements reshape societies globally, revisiting ancient wisdom like Puruṣārtha becomes ever more critical. Balancing the pursuit of material wealth and sensory pleasures with moral duty and spiritual liberation can rekindle a holistic approach to living. This integrated worldview, while benefiting Indian society, holds universal appeal, fostering a balanced, ethical, and fulfilling life for humanity at large.

In a world teetering between progress and moral erosion, the age-old teachings of Puruṣārtha invite us to strive for harmony and meaningful existence. After all, as aptly put by Sri Adi Shankaracharya, "Dharma is the law of conduct by means of which man attains worldly prosperity as well as final beatitude or Moksha."
