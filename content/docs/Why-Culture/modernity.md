The ancient Bharatiya (Indian) Dhrsthi, or worldview, is fundamentally different from the modern perspective on life in several ways. Here are some key elements of the Bharatiya approach and how they contrast with modernity:
### 1. **Dharma (Righteousness and Duty)**
- **Bharatiya Dhrsthi**: Dharma is a central tenet. It encompasses duty, righteousness, and living in accordance with the cosmic law. Dharma is seen as a guiding principle for ethical and moral living, shaped by one's role in society, age, and social position.
- **Modernity**: Modernity often emphasizes individual rights and personal freedoms over collective responsibilities. The ethical frameworks can be more subjective and relativistic, not bound by an overarching cosmic order.
### 2. **Karma (Action and Consequence)**
- **Bharatiya Dhrsthi**: Life is viewed through the lens of Karma, the law of cause and effect. One's actions in this life and past lives directly influence future experiences. This fosters a deep sense of accountability and moral consciousness.
- **Modernity**: While there is acknowledgement of consequences for actions, the modern view tends to be more focused on immediate outcomes and achievements. There is less emphasis on the spiritual and cosmic repercussions of one's actions.
### 3. **Moksha (Liberation)**
- **Bharatiya Dhrsthi**: The ultimate aim of life is Moksha, or liberation from the cycle of birth and death (samsara). This is achieved through self-realization and knowledge (Jnana), devotion (Bhakti), and righteous living (Karma).
- **Modernity**: The focus is often on material success, personal fulfillment, and temporal happiness. Concepts of liberation or enlightenment are either secularized or less emphasized.
### 4. **Interconnectedness with Nature**
- **Bharatiya Dhrsthi**: Nature is revered and seen as an integral part of existence. Humans are viewed as part of a larger cosmic family (Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam), and there is deep respect for all forms of life.
- **Modernity**: There is often a more utilitarian approach to nature, with emphasis on exploitation and control for human benefit. While environmental concerns are increasing, the intrinsic spiritual connection is less pronounced.
### 5. **Community and Relational Living**
- **Bharatiya Dhrsthi**: There is a pronounced emphasis on community and relational living. Joint families, community rituals, and social harmony are highly valued. Social duties often take precedence over individual desires.
- **Modernity**: Individualism is a hallmark of modern life, with personal autonomy and self-assertion taking precedence. The nuclear family has become the dominant social unit.
### 6. **Holistic Education and Knowledge**
- **Bharatiya Dhrsthi**: Education (Vidya) is holistic, integrating physical, mental, and spiritual training. Traditional Gurukuls focused on imparting wisdom that connected the student to their inner self, community, and the universe.
- **Modernity**: Education is often fragmented and utilitarian, designed to meet the demands of the job market. There is less focus on spiritual or holistic development.
### 7. **Temporal and Eternal Time**
- **Bharatiya Dhrsthi**: Time is viewed cyclically through Yugas (ages) with recurring patterns of cosmic evolution and dissolution. There is a sense of eternal continuance.
- **Modernity**: Time is generally seen linearly, with a focus on progress and future potential. The emphasis is on historical development and forward-looking innovation.
### 8. **Health and Wellness**
- **Bharatiya Dhrsthi**: Health is seen holistically as a balance of body, mind, and spirit, encapsulated in practices like Ayurveda and Yoga. Disease is often seen as a disharmony that needs to be corrected by restoring balance.
- **Modernity**: Health tends to be treated more mechanistically. The medical model often focuses on treating symptoms rather than addressing underlying imbalances.
### 9. **Spirituality and Religion**
- **Bharatiya Dhrsthi**: Spirituality is an inherent part of life. Diverse paths to divine realization (Jnana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Karma Yoga, etc.) are respected and encouraged. There is deep tolerance for multiple religious expressions.
- **Modernity**: Secularism and rationalism dominate, often dismissing spirituality as unscientific. Religious practices are sometimes confined to personal life and not seen as central to daily existence.
### Conclusion
The ancient Bharatiya Dhrsthi embodies a broader, more integrated vision of life that emphasizes harmony, duty, and spiritual progress. Modernity, meanwhile, tends to emphasize individualism, material success, and scientific rationalism. Both perspectives offer valuable insights, and integrating elements of both can lead to a more balanced approach to life.
Bharatiya Darshana (Indian philosophical thought) encompasses a rich tapestry of ideas that have evolved over several millennia. Here are some key elements of ancient Bharatiya Darshana and how they differ from modernity:
1. **Metaphysics and Ontology**:
   - **Ancient Bharatiya Darshana**: Emphasizes the concept of Brahman (ultimate reality), Atman (individual soul), and the interconnectedness of all existence through concepts like Maya (illusion) and Karma (action and its consequences).
   - **Modernity**: Tends to focus on materialism, empirical observation, and a more mechanistic view of the universe, often excluding or minimizing metaphysical or spiritual dimensions.
2. **Epistemology**:
   - **Ancient Bharatiya Darshana**: Acknowledges multiple ways of knowing, including direct experience (pratyaksha), inference (anumana), and testimony (shabda).
   - **Modernity**: Primarily relies on empirical evidence and scientific methods as the primary means of acquiring knowledge, often skeptical of non-empirical modes of knowing.
3. **Ethics and Morality**:
   - **Ancient Bharatiya Darshana**: Emphasizes Dharma (righteousness, duty, moral order) and the pursuit of Moksha (liberation) through ethical living, self-discipline, and spiritual practice.
   - **Modernity**: Often focuses on secular ethics, human rights, and principles derived from reason and social consensus, with a lesser emphasis on metaphysical goals like liberation.
4. **Cosmology**:
   - **Ancient Bharatiya Darshana**: Views the cosmos as cyclical, with periods of creation (Srishti), preservation (Sthiti), and dissolution (Pralaya), influenced by cosmic forces and principles (guna).
   - **Modernity**: Often adheres to scientific cosmology based on the Big Bang theory, evolution, and a linear concept of time, without necessarily incorporating metaphysical or cyclical views.
5. **Spiritual Practices**:
   - **Ancient Bharatiya Darshana**: Advocates practices such as meditation (dhyana), yoga, bhakti (devotion), and selfless service (seva) as paths to spiritual realization and union with the divine.
   - **Modernity**: While recognizing the value of practices like meditation and yoga for physical and mental well-being, modernity often approaches them from a secular or therapeutic perspective rather than as integral components of spiritual growth.
6. **Social Organization**:
   - **Ancient Bharatiya Darshana**: Upholds a hierarchical social structure (varna system) based on occupational roles and duties (varna-dharma), with an emphasis on social harmony and collective responsibility.
   - **Modernity**: Advocates for egalitarianism, individual rights, and social justice, often challenging traditional hierarchical structures and promoting equality regardless of birth or occupation.
7. **Worldview and Purpose of Life**:
   - **Ancient Bharatiya Darshana**: Views life as a quest for self-realization (Atma-jnana) and liberation (Moksha), with an overarching purpose of transcending worldly existence (samsara) and realizing one's true nature (Brahman).
   - **Modernity**: Often emphasizes personal fulfillment, achievement, and happiness in the present life, with varying interpretations of life's purpose ranging from existentialism to humanism.
In essence, ancient Bharatiya Darshana is characterized by its holistic approach, integrating metaphysical, ethical, and spiritual dimensions into a comprehensive worldview. In contrast, modernity tends to prioritize empirical observation, scientific inquiry, and secular ethics while often sidelining or excluding metaphysical and spiritual dimensions of human existence.
