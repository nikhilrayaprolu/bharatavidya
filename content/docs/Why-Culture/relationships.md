### The Art of Living: Embracing the Heart of Relating
Life is a journey best lived when we fully engage with the world around us. The essence of truly living lies not just in being alive but in actively engaging and relating with our surroundings. This intricate dance of relationships unfolds countless scenarios, emotions, and experiences that shape our lives. The concept of ishwara, a central reality often missed, plays a critical role in our understanding of life and its purpose.

#### Entering the Realm of Relationships
To live one's life is to relate to the world. This relationality is unavoidable and crucial. When we sleep, we are alive but do not engage with anything; when we dream, we start to relate again, though in a different dimension. This need to relate reveals the pivotal role of relationships in our lives. Interestingly, many struggle with this aspect, often retreating into meditative or secluded states to escape the challenges of relating.
In our cultural context, the issue is not the act of relating itself but rather relating inappropriately due to misunderstandings and misconceptions. A deeper dive into the dynamics of relationships highlights two primary factors: the subject (the one who relates) and the object (what or whom they relate to).

#### The Fluid Nature of Objects
The objects we relate to are ever-changing. Each day brings new people, situations, and experiences into our lives. Friends, acquaintances, and strangers—all form the diverse tapestry of our relational landscape. The central challenge lies in our responses to these variables, particularly since these responses are shaped by our subjective perceptions and personal biases.

#### Perception vs. Reality
Our perceptions heavily influence how we relate to objects. Often, we view objects through a lens of likes and dislikes, shaped by our unique subjective experiences. This subjective interpretation is neither right nor wrong; it simply is a reflection of our individual viewpoints. For instance, one person might adore pumpkin (Karela) while another despises it, each based on personal taste and cultural conditioning.

#### The Central Role: You
Amidst this complex interplay of relationships, the single most important factor remains—you. You are the constant in the ever-changing dynamics of relationships. While others may seem crucial, it is ultimately our perception that grants them importance. This notion reinforces the idea that self-awareness and understanding of one’s role are critical.

#### The Variable and Invariable ‘You’
In every relationship, you wear different hats. You might be a parent in one scenario, a friend in another, and a professional in yet another. Each role comes with its unique script, expectations, and interactions. However, beneath these varying roles lies an invariable ‘you’—your true self, constant amidst the flux.
This invariable self can play its roles effectively when it recognizes its role-playing nature. Confusion arises when the role is mistaken for the person. Recognizing that you are not exclusively any one role but a sum of roles you play can alleviate this confusion. 

#### Mastering the Role Play
Becoming a good actor in life involves understanding the roles you play and their associated scripts. This awareness allows for a smoother transition between roles and a clearer perspective. When the role does not overshadow the individual, it leads to a harmonious existence where relationships are handled with clarity and maturity.

### Embrace the Dance of Life
In conclusion, to live life fully, we must embrace the dance of relationships. Understanding the dynamic between the self and others, navigating subjective perceptions, and recognizing the centrality of the self are all part of this intricate dance. Realizing that life’s essence lies in our ability to relate provides a profound insight into the art of living. So, step into your roles with awareness, honor your invariable self, and master the dance of relating. This is the essence of living a fulfilled life.

**Discovering the Essence of 'I': The Unchanging Core in a World of Roles**
When we utter the word "I," who are we truly referring to? The concept of "I am," when simplified, unveils the essence of our being—a foundational self that transcends the numerous roles we assume throughout our lives. This fundamental identity remains unaltered, even as we shift through various statuses and relationships. 
Upon waking and opening our eyes, we immediately become "the seer." Yet, this seer is not defined by familial labels such as father, mother, sister, or brother. It is our core consciousness that experiences seeing, hearing, and thinking. This conscious self is the basic person, universally constant, notwithstanding the roles we play in relation to others.
### The Fluidity of Roles and Relationships
The basic person continually assumes different roles depending on the context and relationships involved. For instance, you may be an older brother to your younger sibling and a younger brother to your elder sibling. Are you fundamentally an older brother or a younger one? Neither, in essence—these are mere roles assumed based on relational contexts. 
The fundamental issue is recognizing that "I" remain the invariable element assuming various variable statuses or roles. This idea can extend easily to other facets of life: one might be a son, daughter, husband, wife, or professional. Even in roles perceived to be of free choice, such as choosing a career, the underlying basis of every role is given by the larger cosmic framework or what some may call the law of karma.

**The Theater of Life: Embracing Roles Without Losing Yourself**
Have you ever felt overwhelmed by the multitude of roles you play daily? One moment you’re a parent, then a partner, a friend, a colleague, or a community member. Each role brings its own set of expectations and responsibilities. Yet, amidst this dynamic juggle, there's a profound realization that can bring relief and empowerment: the roles are yours to play, but you are not defined by them.
**Understanding the Blessing of Role-Playing**
Role-playing is an intrinsic part of human existence. Each role offers a unique set of experiences and responsibilities. Consider this: a role, when understood properly, gives you the space to fulfill your duties as a father, mother, spouse, child, citizen, or neighbor. Embracing these roles with care, kindness, understanding, and compassion can significantly enrich your life.
But here’s the essential insight: the role is not you. You are the one playing the role. This distinction is crucial. Imagine an actor playing the role of a begging person. The actor, although embodying the character, is aware that he is fundamentally not that character. In real life, the actor might be wealthy and acknowledges that his transient portrayal will eventually add to his financial abundance. Similarly, while immersed in any role, maintaining an awareness of your intrinsic self offers a profound sense of freedom and relief.
**The Conundrum of Identity and Role**
We can delve deeper into this concept by examining the seamless interplay between an actor and their character. While playing the role of a begging person, the actor can convincingly evoke emotions, even shedding real tears, which in turn moves the audience. Despite this deep immersion, the actor remains acutely aware that he is distinct from the role he plays.
This relationship is expressed beautifully through the concept that while the begging person is the actor, the actor is not the begging person. This awareness is crucial. It allows the actor to deliver a compelling performance without losing his intrinsic identity. Similarly, in real life, recognizing that roles are extensions of your capabilities but not the essence of who you are can prevent you from getting lost in those roles.
**Navigating the Complex Roles in Life**
Life is replete with intricate roles that come with their own sets of challenges and joys. The role of a parent, for instance, involves nurturing a child who is an individual in their own right. The child, born from you, is a whole being with their body, mind, and burgeoning sense of self. As a parent, understanding that your role is to guide and nurture without suffocating or over-identifying with the role itself is paramount.
This principle extends to all relationships, whether as a spouse, friend, employee, or citizen. Each role inherently involves problems, and imagining a life or even a movie without problems is unrealistic and unengaging. Consider a storyline devoid of conflict—no one would watch it, as it lacks the essential drama that makes it relatable and compelling.
**Embracing the Space Within Roles**
The key to managing these diverse roles lies in creating internal space. This space allows you to navigate roles without being overtaken by them. In relationships, for example, recognizing the need for space enables healthy interactions and prevents feelings of being overwhelmed.
In the American context, asking for space often translates to seeking a break from the close quarters of a role. This is crucial because no role is free from challenges. Maintaining a conscious awareness that the role is part of you, but not the entirety of you, provides a mental respite, preventing the feeling of crowding or suffocation.
**The Evergreen Presence of Roles**
Roles are inescapable. Avoiding one simply leads to another. The genuine relief lies in embracing the awareness that the role is you, but you are not the role. This understanding forms a foundational relief, offering a sense of space and freedom within one's awareness.
Practicing mindfulness and meditation can reinforce this awareness. By regularly connecting with your intrinsic self—the conscious being behind all roles—you can better manage the complexities and expectations of each role. This practice fosters a sense of stability and inner freedom, empowering you to engage fully and authentically in every role you undertake.
**Conclusion: The Art of Living Through Roles**
Life’s drama is replete with roles, each with its own script of joys and challenges. The essence of well-being lies in recognizing that while these roles are integral parts of our lives, they do not define us. By maintaining a conscious awareness of this distinction, we can fulfill each role with grace and compassion, navigating life with a profound sense of freedom and fulfillment.
Stay tuned, as exploring the depths of this practice and becoming more attuned to your inherent self continues in the ongoing journey of self-discovery and growth. Thank you for joining on this reflective exploration.



### The Cosmic Scheme and Parts We Play
Our existence fits into a grand cosmic scheme, with countless smaller schemes embedded within. From the vastness of the universe to the specificity of one's birthplace, many aspects of who we are and where we find ourselves are predetermined. The roles played by individuals are parts of this grand narrative, and these roles—though sometimes appearing to be a matter of choice—are often influenced by factors beyond our immediate control.
For example, you might find yourself born in a particular continent or country without having had any say in that matter. However, when it comes to roles such as choosing to migrate, even that is subject to various external constraints like visa requirements, hinting at a blend of your past actions and cosmic principles at play.


Every organism in this world fulfills a role, adhering to its inherent programming. Trees, for example, take from the earth only what they need and give back generously, maintaining the balance of the ecosystem. Animals, too, behave according to their nature—carnivores hunt, herbivores graze, and each contributes to the ecological balance. Even bacteria, some of which may cause diseases, have their place in the grand scheme of life.

Humans, too, are contributors and consumers. Ideally, the virtuous among us consume minimally and contribute maximally, an embodiment of spirituality. This principle is vividly exemplified by Mahatma Gandhi, who lived a life of minimal consumption and maximum contribution. He embodied the idea of tyaga, or renunciation, consuming the least and giving the most, which earned him the reverence and status of a Mahatma.

In every role we play—be it as a student, parent, citizen, or friend—our actions should align with our svadharma, or personal duty. This alignment brings us in harmony with Ishwara, creating a state of yoga. Yoga, in this sense, isn't just about physical postures; it's about living harmoniously with the divine order. Performing one's duties, no matter how mundane, with the right attitude and dedication, is tantamount to worship. 

Even simple tasks—like doing laundry—illustrate this point. Procrastinating such chores creates mental burden, but completing them brings a sense of relief and fulfillment. This sense of responsibility and duty makes our actions a form of worship, aligning us with the cosmic order.

Ultimately, every individual, like every tree in a forest, is a part of a larger whole. Just as each tree is essential to the forest yet distinct, each person is integral to the cosmic order yet has unique roles and responsibilities. Recognizing this interconnectedness and performing one's duties with this awareness is the essence of living in harmony with Ishwara. This commitment transforms our daily activities into spiritual practices, contributing to the grand cosmic yajna.

In this continuous dance of creation, every action, no matter how small, holds significance. By understanding and embodying this perspective, we not only find our place in the universe but also contribute to maintaining its divine harmony.

### The Importance of Tradition and Duty in Society
In many traditions, roles come with predefined scripts handed down through generations, imparting a sense of duty and respect. A well-structured society places emphasis on duties over rights. When each individual fulfills their duties, the rights naturally follow, fostering a community where mutual respect and harmony prevail.
The script of a role, whether as a parent, professional, or citizen, is centered around duty (swakarma). Performing one's duty is viewed as an act of worship, aligning oneself with the larger cosmic order (Ishwara). This alignment is essential for achieving personal fulfillment and success.

### Conclusion: Embracing the Invariable in a World of Variables
The journey of understanding the "I" involves recognizing the constant amidst the changing. The various roles—each a part of a larger scheme—are interwoven into the fabric of existence, each carrying its own responsibilities and scripts. By fulfilling our duties, we contribute to the harmony of the cosmic order.
Our individual growth lies in embracing these roles while remembering the unchanging core of our being. By doing so, we find balance, fulfillment, and a deeper connection to the expansive universe in which we play our parts.


### The Inner Sanctum: A Journey to Self-Awareness and Duty
In today’s high-stress environment, we are often ensnared in various roles—parent, employee, citizen—that create tension and stress. However, there is a hidden dimension within us that is naturally free from tension. Tapping into this inner sanctum not only alleviates stress but also enlightens our understanding of duty and responsibility.
#### The Burden of Roles
Role-playing in real life is as complicated, if not more so, than acting on stage. With every role—be it as parents, siblings, spouses, or employees—comes a set of expectations and responsibilities. These expectations, when coupled with anxiety and a lack of self-awareness, create stress. Imagine the pressure parents feel to ensure their child grows up well. This anxiety, compounded by a lack of awareness of one's inner self, leads to accumulated tensions.
#### Seeking Diversions
When stress becomes unbearable, society also presents us with myriad diversions. Whether it's seeking entertainment, taking vacations, or other forms of mental escapism, we search for ways to relax and unwind. This relentless pursuit of relaxation points to a deeper, unacknowledged need within us—to return to a state of natural, unprejudiced awareness.
#### The Spiritual Culture of India: A Model of Interconnectedness
India's spiritual culture has long understood the importance of balancing roles with recognizing the person behind the role. The roles we play are laden with duties, and these duties are interconnected, creating a societal structure based on mutual responsibility. In this culture, even plants, trees, and animals have rights, as they too play their roles in the ecosystem. The essence is the acknowledgment that every being is interconnected and interdependent.
#### Remembering and Acknowledging Contributions
In Indian tradition, acknowledging one's ancestors, gods, and sages—whose contributions we benefit from—is a practice of gratitude. Remembering these contributors is not an empty gesture but an actionable duty, manifested through various rituals and offerings. From feeding animals to performing yoga, these acts are considered offerings—or ‘yajnas’—demonstrating a deep respect for all forms of life.
#### Self-Care: The First Duty
Caring for oneself is also seen as a duty. The body, viewed not as an individual possession but as a gifted entity, must be maintained and respected. Yoga, with its balanced approach to physical and mental wellness, is considered the best form of exercise for this purpose. The concept of self-care extends beyond mere physical maintenance; it encompasses the understanding that the body is a trust to be managed wisely.
#### The Legal Parable of Devadatta
An enlightening story from Indian literature perfectly encapsulates this philosophy. Devadatta, believing he owned his body, was challenged by various familial and societal stakeholders—all laying claim to his body based on their contributions and relations. In the end, the judge ruled that Devadatta himself was the managing trustee of the body, entrusted to care for it responsibly. This allegory underscores the notion that the body is a composite entity, sustained by multiple factors, and not a personal possession to be misused or neglected.
#### Conclusion: Manage the Trust
The take-home message from both Indian philosophy and the legal parable is strikingly clear: we are trustees of our own bodies. Just as one would care for a trusted friend’s valuable item, we must care for our bodies with the same diligence and respect. This approach shifts the perception of the body from ownership to guardianship, fostering a more holistic and respectful relationship with oneself and one's environment.
Embracing this mindset can help alleviate the stress created by role-playing in modern society. By recognizing our interconnectedness and responsibilities, we can find a more meaningful and balanced way to live, anchored in the timeless wisdom of self-awareness and mutual respect.

### The Illusion of Ownership: A Path to True Freedom
In our modern world, the concept of ownership is deeply embedded in our daily lives. From owning a house to claiming intellectual property, the sense of 'mine' pervades our existence. But what if this very sense of ownership is an illusion that confines us rather than liberating us? This article explores the profound philosophy that suggests we are mere trustees of our possessions—including our bodies—and how liberation lies in understanding and embracing this truth.
#### The Concept of Ownership
Let's begin with the most intimate 'possession' one can conceive: our own body. The instant we lay claim to ownership of our body, we create a paradox. The body is not an object we have created or bought; it is a gift given to us by nature or, if you will, the universe. Hence, the most appropriate role we can assume is that of a managing trustee rather than an outright owner.
We are uniquely positioned to care for our bodies because of our intimate relationship with them. No one else has the same degree of connection or responsibility, making us effectively the best caretakers. Applying this logic universally, the notion of ownership becomes questionable. If we cannot genuinely own our bodies, how can we claim true ownership of anything else?
#### Legal Titles vs. Sense of Ownership
In modern societies, legal systems provide us titles that declare us the owners of houses, cars, and even intellectual properties. However, these titles are given by external authorities and can be taken away. Real ownership is an internal sense, far deeper and more subjective. When we acknowledge that our body is not ours, it becomes clear that claiming ownership of external objects is an extension of this illusion.
#### Intellectual Property and Collective Contributions
Even intellectual property, often seen as a product of one's genius, is a collective endeavor. The faculties we use for invention or discovery—our intellect, ability to explore, and capacity for inquiry—are inherently given to us, much like our bodies. These attributes are shaped by countless influences, experiences, and societal inputs, thereby reducing the legitimacy of our claim to personal ownership. 
#### The Freedom of Tiaga: Giving Up Ownership
In certain cultures, particularly in various spiritual traditions, the concept of 'Tiaga' or renunciation is heavily emphasized. Misconceptions abound that renunciation means giving up material possessions. However, Tiaga fundamentally signifies freeing oneself from the sense of ownership. True freedom isn't about becoming materially impoverished but about unshackling oneself from the illusion of ownership.
The prayer song "Jaya Jagaddi Sahare" beautifully captures this concept. It speaks of offering back everything—body, mind, wealth—that we mistakenly believe we own, signifying a return to the universe. This act of offering, or Tiaga, is deeply liberating, as it releases us from the smallness that the sense of ownership imposes.
#### The Reality Check: Do We Truly Own Anything?
Ownership, especially of tangible property, is illusory. Consider the example of owning a flat in a multi-story building. Do you own the land on which the building stands? No. Do you own the floor under your flat or the ceiling above it? These, too, belong to others. Our "ownership" is limited to a small, often inconsequential, part of a much larger structure, highlighting the fragmented and incomplete nature of our claims.
#### Embracing True Freedom
Acknowledging that we do not truly own anything, including our bodies, frees us from the constraints of this illusion. Once we shed the confines of perceived ownership, we open ourselves up to a more expansive way of living. This understanding allows us to appreciate life and its offerings without the burden of 'mine.'
#### Who Am I?
With this newfound freedom, a deeper question emerges: who am I? If neither body, mind, nor possessions define us, then what does? Our spiritual culture often provides profound insights into this inquiry. While various beliefs and religions offer different perspectives, a common theme emerges: the self is a mystery, not easily confined to tangible definitions. 
In many spiritual traditions, the self is seen as something that doesn't need to be saved or improved. It's already perfect and complete. The real task is liberating oneself from the confusions and illusions that obscure this intrinsic freedom and completeness.
#### Conclusion
In essence, relinquishing the illusion of ownership liberates us from the constricted sense of self and opens the doorway to true freedom. The journey involves a deep introspective look at our beliefs and notions about ownership, ultimately leading to a more expansive, liberated way of living. This freedom allows us to engage with the world in a more meaningful and fulfilling manner, unburdened by the limitations of 'mine.'
This exploration isn't merely philosophical but has practical implications. It challenges us to rethink our relationship with our possessions, our bodies, and even our intellect, fostering a life of greater sanity, dispassion, and profound freedom.
