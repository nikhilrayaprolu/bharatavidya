Allow me to pose a question: How many of you believe in God? Can you please raise your hand? Why do we believe in God? Who told us to? Belief in God often comes without verification; it's a societal default that we inherit and follow. But what does belief truly mean? It signifies accepting something as true without verifying it. It's an assumption that numbs our reasoning, halting our thought process and intellectual exploration.

Consider the story of a Sufi saint who visited a village. The villagers, recognizing him as a holy figure, invited him to their mosque. When they asked him to share wisdom about God, he first asked the congregation how many of them believed in God. Almost everyone raised their hands. The Sufi then declined to speak further, saying that their belief had already stopped them from thinking and questioning, which means they had accepted a reality without investigation or experience.

**The Essence of Knowing Over Believing**

Let's pause and reflect: do you believe you are human, or do you know you are human? There's a profound difference. Belief is a lower level of reality compared to knowing. Knowing something involves direct experience and verification, whereas belief is accepting without evidence. In the Indian tradition, particularly in Vedanta philosophy, the emphasis is on knowing, not believing. True seekers do not accept anything as real until they have verified it themselves. This quest for knowledge over mere belief leads to a deeper, more authentic spiritual experience.

**Vedanta: The Path of Knowing**

Within Vedanta, the concept of God (Ishwara) and the universe is not based on faith but on verification and knowing. Unlike many religious doctrines that train followers to believe in a specific idea of God, Vedanta encourages seekers to verify and experience the divine for themselves.

**Redefining God: From Concept to Experience**

Let's redefine God within the Vedanta framework. The world, with all its intricate order—from cosmic phenomena to microscopic processes—reflects an underlying intelligence. This intelligence is referred to as God in Vedanta. God isn't a figure sitting somewhere but the all-pervading intelligence that sustains the universe.
Another critical aspect of Vedanta’s understanding of God is that God (Ishwara) pervades the entire universe. This isn’t a matter of belief; it's a matter of recognizing and experiencing that intelligence and order in everything—from the rising and setting of the sun to the very functioning of our bodies. 

**The Illusion of Separation**

We often perceive God as separate from the world, but Vedanta teaches that the universe is not separate from God. Everything we see, feel, and experience is an expression of the divine. When we look at the world, we are seeing manifestations of God, yet because of our conditioned beliefs, we fail to recognize this divine presence.

**Transforming Worship and Life**

In Indian culture, every aspect of creation is viewed as divine. We worship rivers, plants, and even stones like the Saligrama, recognizing them as manifestations of the divine. This reverence isn't symbolic but a profound acknowledgment of the unity of all existence. When we touch a stone, we are touching the divine because that stone is a part of the total reality that is God.

**Living with Ishwara: A Divine Life**

Understanding that God is existence itself transforms our daily life. There's no longer a distinction between the material and the spiritual—every aspect of life becomes divine. Our actions, from the mundane to the sacred, become acts of worship, honoring the divine order (Dharma) that sustains the universe.
Vedanta doesn’t stress belief in God but recognizes that every moment of our lives, every breath we take, is an interaction with the divine. Proper understanding thus means seeing God in every experience, not merely during religious rituals. By living with this awareness, our lives become a continuous act of reverence.

**Experiencing God in Daily Life**

The great saints and seers were not special because of extraordinary experiences but because of their profound understanding. Their ability to see God in every moment stemmed from their clear, unwavering awareness that everything is God.
Kabir, the mystic poet, expressed it beautifully when he said that he sees God in everything—everywhere he looks, walks, and listens, he finds God. This wasn’t a special experience but a result of his understanding.

**Conclusion: The Path Forward**

Each of us must strive to correct our understanding, moving from the conditioned beliefs of society to the clear vision offered by Vedanta. Understanding that God is not separate from the world, but the very essence of it, turns every aspect of our lives into a spiritual journey, making our existence itself a prayer.

Let's not bring God into our lives as a separate entity; let's recognize that Ishwara is our life. By aligning our understanding with this truth, we too can live a divine life, where every experience is a direct interaction with the divine. In doing so, we fulfill the highest teachings of Vedanta, making our life a manifestation of divine harmony and order.


Imagine waking up one day and realizing that everything in the world is not just randomly assembled, but is part of a well-structured and thoughtfully orchestrated system. The world, or *Jagat*, is like a harmonious symphony where every detail is deliberately arranged. Our senses, mind, and reasoning abilities are gifts that help us navigate this complex web of existence. Understanding this deeper truth can be both humbling and enlightening.

## Understanding the Gifts We Have

In our quest to understand the world, we often overlook that our ability to perceive, remember, and reason is itself a gift. Each sensory experience, memory, and rational thought helps us comprehend the world. Even if we don't always understand the outcomes of our actions, there is a clear connection: every action has a result. These results may not always be visible or understandable immediately, but they are not random. There is an underlying reason and intelligence.

### Discovering the Complexity

As we explore more, we appreciate the complexities of our existence—our eyes, minds, and bodies. Each organism, from tiny bacteria to large mammals, showcases this complexity. Given this intricate setup, certain things naturally happen. Stars are born and die, species evolve, and ecosystems change—all part of a grand, well-crafted plan.

## The Role of Choice and Effort

While the grand scheme provides many possibilities, living beings, including humans, have the unique ability to create specific outcomes through their efforts. For example, a beaver building a dam or bees constructing a honeycomb use their innate abilities. In humans, this manifests as creativity and invention, like developing new technology. These are possibilities waiting to be realized through human effort.

### The Illusion of Control

Society often credits individuals for discoveries and inventions—like Newton’s laws or Pascal’s principles. However, these individuals were simply in the right place at the right time. The ability to understand, make choices, and follow through on actions is also given to us. We are responsible for our actions (karma), but not for the results (karma-phala). If we controlled outcomes, all our desires would come true, which is clearly not the case.

## The Idea of a Giver

If everything is given, it raises a philosophical question: is there a giver? Considering the complexity and intelligence behind the universe—every cell, organ, and natural law—we cannot dismiss the idea of a masterful designer. This designer, or **Srishti Karta**, is all-powerful and all-knowing, embodying the essence of intelligent creation.

### Indigenous Wisdom

In Indian culture, this understanding is deeply rooted. Ask a villager about the whereabouts of *Bhagavan* (God), and you might get a bemused look, as if you asked whether the sun rises from the west. To them, *Bhagavan* is everywhere. Their reverence for nature—the air, stars, trees, birds, fire, and water—reflects their recognition of the divine presence in everything.

To such a person, asking "Where is God?" is almost laughable. Instead, the question "What is God?" is more fitting, as it acknowledges God's presence in our immediate reality, which is a fundamental belief in the daily life and spiritual ethos of an Indian villager.

#### The Question of Bhagavan's Existence
When we ask, "What is Bhagavan?" rather than "Where is Bhagavan?", we embark on a deeper, more enlightening inquiry. By asking "where," we inadvertently impose physical constraints on a concept that transcends them. To comprehend Bhagavan, we must move beyond the limitations of time and space, understanding that Bhagavan is not confined to a specific form, location, or persona.
### The All-Encompassing Nature of Bhagavan
Consider the following illustration: suppose Bhagavan is everything. In the teachings of many indigenous Indian traditions, there is a profound reverence for all existence, an attitude that springs from an underlying understanding. This understanding can be imparted because it is not just an innate belief but a form of knowledge passed down through generations.
However, if this attitude is not grounded in understanding, it can falter under confusion. When rooted in understanding, it remains unshaken despite external disturbances. This depth of wisdom is one of the hallmarks of India's rich cultural heritage.
In this tradition, Bhagavan encompasses all that is known and unknown — a concept known as **Sarvam**. This Sarvam, or totality, is considered **Srishti** (creation), intelligently crafted.
#### The Intelligent Creator
The analogy of a pot maker synthesizes this idea. Just as a pot maker understands the purpose, material, and skills required to craft a pot, the creation of the universe (Jagat Srishti) encompasses deep knowledge and skill. 
All knowledge, as understood here, rests within a conscious being. Knowledge — whether partial or complete — implies the presence of consciousness. Without consciousness, there can be neither knowledge nor ignorance. Thus, the existence and intricate design of the universe point toward an all-knowing (Sarvajna) and all-powerful (Sarvashaktimaan) conscious entity.
### Ishwara: The Maker and the Made
The essence of Ishwara is not limited to the role of a mere creator but extends to being the very substance of creation itself. In other words, Ishwara embodies both the maker and the material cause of the universe. This duality, or more precisely, this unity, is fundamental in appreciating the true nature of Ishwara. Any conceptualization of a God that exists separately from the material world falls short of this comprehensive understanding.
When we delve deeper into the nature of existence, even from a scientific perspective, every visible form can ultimately be reduced to formless particles. This resonates with the idea that Ishwara is both formless and all-encompassing in form. No form exists independently of the formless Ishwara. The interconnectedness suggests that nothing is separate from Ishwara, making the entire universe a sacred manifestation of this divine entity.
#### Bhagavan as Material and Creator
A profound question arises: can the creator of the universe and the material from which it is made be separate? In traditional Indian teachings, they cannot be. The creator (Srishti Karta) and the material are intertwined aspects of Bhagavan. There cannot exist a separating factor, such as space or time, between the creator and the creation. 
Space, time, and everything within the universe are manifestations of Bhagavan. Hence, when the villager says everything is Bhagavan, it encapsulates a great truth recognized in India's spiritual wisdom. Every element — from the earth beneath our feet to the expansive sky — is a form of Bhagavan. 
#### A Manifestation, Not an Outsider
Rather than envisioning Bhagavan as a distant entity orchestrating the cosmos, Indian cultural understanding sees creation (Srishti) as a manifestation (Abhivyakti) of the divine. This nuanced comprehension offers a vision of the universe where every element is a tangible expression of the divine essence.

### The Manifestation of Ishwara
Every element of time and space holds sanctity as it manifests Ishwara. Whether it's the seconds ticking by or the vast expanse of the cosmos, every fragment is a part of Ishwara. This is not a mere abstract belief but a profound reality to be understood, akin to comprehending complex subjects like mathematics or physics. In our heritage, Ishwara is everything, and thus our approach to life is anchored in this holistic understanding.
For instance, consider the analogy of a fabric and a shirt. The fabric (Ishwara) can exist independently without being a shirt (the world), but the shirt cannot exist without the fabric. This illustrates that while the unmanifest (Ishwara) can exist without the world, the manifest world is inseparable from Ishwara.
### The Dream Analogy
In dreams, we create worlds instantaneously with our thoughts. This creation requires both knowledge and immense power, as everything dreamt is a projection of our mind. The dream includes sun, space, time, earth, and all objects, which are manifestations of our knowledge and memories. Just as in our dreams, where we are both the creator and the material, Ishwara's knowledge manifests the universe we inhabit. Thus, the entire creation is an extension of Ishwara’s knowledge.

### The Concept of Ishwara and the Jagat

Everything in the universe (Jagat) is seen as a manifestation of Ishwara. This understanding challenges the separation between the creator (the giver) and the creation (the given), emphasizing that the universe, including our physical and mental beings, is an expression of divine knowledge.

### The Orders of Manifestation

To grasp this, we must explore the different 'orders' or realms in which this manifestation occurs:

1.  **Physical Order:** Studied in various branches of physics, it deals with the fundamental laws governing the universe.
2.  **Biological Order:** Explored in biology, it involves the study of life and living organisms.
3.  **Physiological Order:** Covered in physiology and medicine, it examines the functions and mechanisms in a living system.
4.  **Psychological Order:** Crucial for human understanding, this delves into the workings of the human mind and behavior.
5.  **Order of Dharma:** Unique to human beings due to their endowed choice, it involves ethical and moral principles guiding human actions.


### The Indian Cultural Milieu
In understanding Bhagavan, we grasp a fundamental pillar of Indian culture. It's not about locating a deity in a physical realm but recognizing the omnipresence of divinity in every facet of existence. This holistic view fosters a culture of reverence, inclusivity, and respect for all creation.
