"Understanding is unshakeable, while belief is subject to challenge."

"Bharatiya culture embraces Sahajata—simplicity and natural beingness—promoting inner and outer harmony, integrity, duty consciousness, and the growth into mature individuals."

As teachers and parents, we realize that we can only impart as much as we have truly understood ourselves. So this is a material for one to understand our culture.

### We are spiritual beings on a temporary journey in the physical realm, guided by principles that reflect our true nature.

The fundamental attitude of Sanathana Dharma that "we are spiritual beings having a temporary stay in a physical body" is indeed the core principle from which all the practices and values towards life derive. 

1. Spiritual nature: 
This is the direct expression of the core attitude. Recognizing our spiritual essence shifts focus from material pursuits to spiritual growth.

2. Temporary physical existence:
The understanding that our physical existence is temporary naturally leads to:
   - Detachment from material possessions and outcomes
   - A focus on long-term spiritual consequences (karma) over short-term material gains
   - Reduced fear of death and a different perspective on life's challenges

3. Interconnectedness:
If we are all spiritual beings temporarily inhabiting physical forms, it follows that we share a common spiritual essence. This understanding naturally promotes:
   - Unity in diversity
   - Compassion and empathy towards others
   - Respect for all forms of life, including nature
   - Ethical behavior towards others (Dharma) as the spiritual essence is one in all of us
   - Fulfillment of societal and familial responsibilities

4. Self-realization:
The goal of realizing our true spiritual nature becomes paramount, leading to:
   - Practices like meditation and yoga for spiritual growth
   - Reduced dependence on external validation
   - A quest for higher knowledge and understanding

6. Moderation and balance:
Understanding our dual nature as spiritual beings in physical bodies promotes:
   - Balanced approach to material and spiritual aspects of life
   - Moderation in pursuits, avoiding extremes

7. Holistic well-being:
Recognizing the interplay between our spiritual essence and physical existence encourages:
   - Care for both spiritual and physical health
   - Practices that integrate mind, body, and spirit


#### The Essence of Sanathana Dharma

At its core, Sanathana Dharma is rooted in the understanding that every individual is an integral part of a larger cosmic order. This ancient philosophy teaches that the universe is a unified entity where every element, from the smallest particle to the largest celestial body, is interdependent. This holistic vision encourages individuals to see beyond their personal desires and recognize their role in maintaining the equilibrium of the entire cosmos.

It offers guiding principles that help individuals navigate their lives in a way that promotes harmony and balance. The focus is on Dharma, which can be understood as the natural law or duty that sustains the order of the universe. Dharma is context-specific and varies according to one's stage in life, personal capacities, and societal role. This adaptability ensures that Sanathana Dharma remains relevant and applicable across diverse circumstances and eras.

#### Culture as a Reflection of Spiritual Values

Indian culture is a rich mosaic comprising language, music, sculpture, lifestyle, and values, all of which are reflections of its spiritual roots. The Indian attitude towards the world is fundamentally different from many Western perspectives. Where some cultures may view the natural world as a resource for human consumption, Indian culture sees it as a manifestation of the divine. This worldview fosters a symbiotic relationship where humans and nature protect and nurture each other.

The intricate web of life, often referred to in Sanskrit as "Jagat," is not merely a creation but a manifestation of Ishwara, the divine Lord. This profound understanding permeates every aspect of Indian culture, creating a unique worldview that integrates spirituality with practical living.

Daily practices, rituals, and the very fabric of social life are influenced by this holistic worldview. For example, daily acts of charity and prayer are seen as ways to neutralize any harm done in the course of survival. This continuous cycle of giving and seeking forgiveness underscores a deep-seated awareness of the interconnectedness of all life.

### Purpose and Direction in Life
The essence of Indian spirituality lies in the belief that the ultimate goals of human existence are to be realized within this lifetime. Fulfillment and purpose do not await us beyond death but are to be achieved here and now. This vision imbues our lives with direction and meaning. When we understand that our existence has a definite goal, our way of life naturally aligns with this understanding, fostering a coherent and harmonious life journey.


### The Culture of Self-Growth and Self-Discovery
Our culture, rich with self-discipline and self-growth, often gets overshadowed by the clamoring demands of a competitive society. Historically, there was no race for occupational supremacy; one's profession was often inherited, thereby eliminating the stress of career choices and competitive advancement. This allowed individuals to focus on personal development and societal contribution, weaving a fabric of a culture deeply embedded in self-discovery and altruism.

### The Essence of Giving – Yagna
The quintessence of our cultural practice revolves around giving—an act that transcends mere kindness to become a cornerstone for personal growth. Giving, termed as "Abhiyasa," is recommended with sincerity and without any patronizing demeanor. This form of selfless service is neither an investment nor a transaction but a heartfelt contribution aimed at community upliftment and personal enlightenment.


#### Duties as a Contribution to Collective Welfare

One of the most profound aspects of Sanathana Dharma is its emphasis on duties (known as 'Svadharma') that contribute to the welfare of the whole community. In this worldview, every action taken by an individual reverberates through the social fabric, impacting the collective well-being. By fulfilling their duties conscientiously, individuals not only achieve personal fulfillment but also contribute to the harmony and prosperity of society.

The duties in Sanathana Dharma are categorized into various types, including:

1. **Personal Duties (Aatma Dharma):** These involve self-care, personal growth, and spiritual practices. By maintaining physical health, mental clarity, and spiritual purity, individuals prepare themselves to serve society more effectively.

2. **Familial Duties (Kutumba Dharma):** Responsibilities towards family members, such as caring for parents, raising children with ethical values, and maintaining family harmony, are crucial. A strong family unit forms the foundation of a stable society.

3. **Societal Duties (Samaaja Dharma):** These encompass broader responsibilities towards the community, including acts of charity, social service, and participating in communal activities. Engaging in these duties fosters social cohesion and mutual support.

4. **Universal Duties (Vishwa Dharma):** This includes duties towards the environment and all living beings. Protecting nature, practicing non-violence, and promoting global peace are integral to sustaining the universal balance.

#### Everyday Life as a Contribution

In Sanathana Dharma, every day presents opportunities to contribute to societal welfare. Simple, everyday actions, when performed with awareness and a sense of duty, accumulate to create a significant positive impact. Whether it is through the practice of honesty in professional dealings, kindness in social interactions, or mindfulness in environmental conservation, each act becomes a sacred offering to the collective good.

This perspective encourages individuals to live with a sense of purpose and responsibility. By aligning personal actions with the broader goal of universal harmony, life gains a deeper meaning. The emphasis is not on the grandeur of the acts but on the intention and consciousness behind them. Every small effort counts, and when multiplied across the community, these efforts lead to a harmonious and prosperous society.


#### INTRODUCTION TO FORM AND SPIRIT OF VEDIC CULTURE  


The Vedic vision and way of life have sustained the Indian culture through the ages. The Vedas have ruled the hearts of generations of people and inspired them to live a life of dharma. The society has provided forms by which an individual is initiated into the Vedic culture. Forms such as worship, festivals, drama, poetry, language and arts have carried great significance in providing for the individual's inner growth and in establishing a link between the past and contemporary society.

For any society to remain dynamic in the fast-changing world, its forms must change to keep pace with the changing times. As forms change, there may be conflicts between the current demands of the society and traditions from the past. Often conflicts may arise as to which aspects of the forms should be retained and which should be given up.

One needs to appreciate the role of sāmānya-dharma, universal codes of conduct, as well as viśeṣa-dharma, specific codes of conduct, in order to adapt forms relevant to one’s society. While sāmānya-dharma is universal in nature, its expression can vary from culture to culture and within a culture, from time to time. This variance in the cultural expression of a universal value is known as viśeṣa-dharma. Over time, some cultural forms remain recognizable while others do not. In all these changes, however, the universal dharma behind the forms is retained, giving meaning to the changing forms.

For example, in ancient times, there was a tradition of deva-dāsīs, female temple dancers, who dedicated their lives to the Lord. They lived a spiritual life in the temple, where they sang and danced in praise of the temple deity. Today, even though this tradition of deva-dāsīs attached to temples is not found anywhere, every dance concert begins and concludes with a prayer to the teacher and to the Lord. The artists create an altar in a corner of the stage, and the dance itself becomes an offering, as it was with the deva-dāsīs. Thus even though the expression of this custom has changed over time, the spirit of devotion continues.

When the spirit of a tradition is not understood, it is essential that its forms be retained. Even though forms devoid of spirit may appear to be meaningless expressions, one cannot eliminate forms from one’s life. Cultural forms provide one with an infrastructure for the expression of all aspects of human life. Only by retaining the forms and attempting to re-establish meaning into them is there any possibility of discovering the spirit that enlivens the forms. For example, a ritual of prayer done daily out of will should eventually help the person discover real devotion. Devotion and prayer are connected as cause and effect. When there is lack of devotion, one can discover it as one keeps the form of prayer going.

Children of Indian immigrants in the West are often told by their parents to touch the feet of elders as a mark of respect. This cultural form is often resented by a child because he does not appreciate the spirit behind it. But, if a child continues to practise the form, without being pressured to do so by his parents, he may eventually appreciate the spirit of reverence. Understanding the significance of cultural forms is essential for preserving the identity of one’s culture in a foreign land.

If the spirit of one’s own tradition is not understood, one will naturally be drawn to forms that are available in other cultures. Where alternatives are available, one is naturally inclined to choose forms based on one’s likes and dislikes which may compromise one’s values. For example, the Hindu culture subscribes to vegetarian foods primarily because of the value of noninjury. But if one grows up without an understanding of this value, one is likely to choose a non-vegetarian diet.
