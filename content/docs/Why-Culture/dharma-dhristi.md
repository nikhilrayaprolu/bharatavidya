## Redifing Success in Modern Education - From Consumer-Driven Rat Race to Societal Contribution

Ancient Indian education (Bharatiya Vidya) stood in stark contrast to modern educational paradigms, particularly in its approach to future occupations. In pre-colonial times, individuals typically followed their family's trade (kula vritti), enabling focused and relevant education from an early age. Today's educational landscape, however, predominantly focuses on preparing students for the job market, often without clear guidance on discovering their true calling (svadharma).

This shift has led to significant challenges in the modern educational journey. 

1. Students often face prolonged periods of study as they struggle to identify their vocation.

2. While traditional occupations were esteemed for their role in maintaining societal balance and contribution, modern pressures steer students towards lucrative professions and individual success. Today, students face the daunting task of selecting a career amidst incessant media and peer pressure promoting consumerism and wealth accumulation.

This focus on consumption and competition often overshadows the fundamental principle of contributing to society, which lies at the heart of true fulfillment and purpose of life.

 As a result, students may define their svadharma based on:
- Personal preferences (raga and dvesha)
- The ego's need for superiority over peers
- Desire for societal status

To provide students with the clarity (viveka) needed to navigate their paths meaningfully, we must rediscover the principle of dharma as responsibility towards universal harmony and societal contribution. By embracing this approach, students can:

1. Free themselves from the pressures of the rat race
2. Alleviate the stress of constant comparison and competition
3. Align their choices with their true inner calling

In conclusion, by reorienting our educational goals towards societal contribution rather than mere personal gain, we can foster a generation of individuals who are not only successful in their chosen fields but also instrumental in creating a more harmonious and sustainable world.
