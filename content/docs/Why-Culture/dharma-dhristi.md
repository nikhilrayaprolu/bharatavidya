## Redifing Success in Modern Education - From Consumer-Driven Rat Race to Societal Contribution

Ancient Indian education (Bharatiya Vidya) stood in stark contrast to modern educational paradigms, particularly in its approach to future occupations. In pre-colonial times, individuals typically followed their family’s trade (kula vritti), enabling focused and relevant education from an early age. Today’s educational landscape, however, predominantly focuses on preparing students for the job market, often without clear guidance on discovering their true calling (svadharma).

This shift has led to significant challenges in the modern educational journey:

- Students often face prolonged periods of study as they struggle to identify their vocation.
- Traditional occupations were esteemed for their role in maintaining societal balance and contribution, whereas modern pressures steer students towards lucrative professions and individual success.
- Today, students face the daunting task of selecting a career amidst incessant media and peer pressure promoting consumerism and wealth accumulation.
- This focus on consumption and competition often overshadows the fundamental principle of contributing to society, which lies at the heart of true fulfillment and purpose of life.

As a result, students may define their svadharma based on:

- Personal preferences (raga and dvesha)
- The ego’s need for superiority over peers
- Desire for societal status

To provide students with the clarity (viveka) needed to navigate their paths meaningfully, we must rediscover the principle of dharma as responsibility towards universal harmony and societal contribution. By embracing this approach, students can:

- Free themselves from the pressures of the rat race
- Alleviate the stress of constant comparison and competition
- Align their choices with their true inner calling

In conclusion, by reorienting our educational goals towards societal contribution rather than mere personal gain, we can foster a generation of individuals who are not only successful in their chosen fields but also instrumental in creating a more harmonious and sustainable world. This approach can empower children to live more meaningful and balanced lives.

- Embracing a dharmic perspective nurtures emotional, ethical, and social intelligence, making children more resilient and adaptable.
- Modern society often equates success with material wealth and status, which can lead to perpetual dissatisfaction. By aligning life with dharma, the child is more likely to experience genuine fulfillment and purpose, which are crucial for long-term happiness.
- Prioritizing societal contribution instills a sense of responsibility and empathy, leading to the development of compassionate leaders and innovators who work for the greater good.
- This sustainable approach also mitigates the stress and burnout commonly associated with the rat race.
- Moreover, those who follow their unique path can stand out more in a competitive world, achieving success that is both distinctive and impactful.
- While it may seem challenging to diverge from the competitive world, fostering a dharmic approach to education equips children with the values, skills, and resilience needed to thrive, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling and successful life.
