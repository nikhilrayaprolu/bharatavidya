### The Interplay of Self-Esteem, Dharma, and Spiritual Growth
Navigating the intricate balance between self-esteem and Dharma is an age-old challenge, a delicate dance that our internal and external worlds must perform in unison. Often, we find ourselves trapped in a cycle, seeking self-esteem to follow Dharma, yet needing Dharma for self-esteem. How do we break free from this mutual dependence? The answer lies in understanding and harnessing both internal and external sources of support.
#### Tapping Into Internal and External Sources of Support
When pressures mount from unfulfilled desires, it becomes crucial to use our willpower effectively. However, this is easier said than done. Without a robust self-esteem, the pressure from desires can feel overwhelming. Thus, enhancing self-esteem becomes a pivotal step in this journey. 
When internal strength falls short, external support becomes necessary. Often, group support can provide the much-needed reinforcement. This is akin to a Satsang—a community of like-minded individuals committed to spiritual growth. Together, they foster an environment where everyone works to uplift each other, creating a collective sense of purpose and achievement.
#### Grace and Inner Strength
Grace, in its most profound form, is akin to subterranean water—always present but requiring effort to access. This grace can significantly aid in overcoming the pressures exerted by desires. In spiritual terms, grace can be invoked through prayer and acts of selfless service. These acts, known as reaching out or Purthakarma, help in building inner strength or Atma Bala.
#### Free Will and Prayer
Free will, expressed through prayer, is another powerful tool for self-transformation. Prayer is not just a ritual but an expression of one's deepest intentions and desires, aligning individual actions with higher spiritual goals. It’s a declaration of one's willingness to grow, seek help, and ultimately conform to Dharma.

**The Power of Prayer in Discovering Inner Strength: Understanding the Concept of Atma-Balam**
In today's fast-paced world, finding inner peace and strength can seem like a monumental task. Yet, the ancient wisdom encapsulated in the concept of "atma-balam" offers a profound pathway towards developing and rediscovering our inherent strength. Atma-balam, a term rooted in Sanskrit, literally translates to "self-strength." It is a cultivation of inner fortitude that transcends mere physical endurance or mental resilience. When we engage with prayer and a prayerful life, as prescribed in many spiritual traditions, we unlock the potential of atma-balam, enriching our lives with grace, fulfillment, and a robust sense of well-being.
**Reaching Beyond Desires to Discover Real Strength**
One of the fundamental teachings of atma-balam is the idea that when we reach beyond our desires, we grow. Desires often hold us captive, creating an illusion that fulfilling them will lead to contentment. However, true strength emerges when we master our desires rather than being controlled by them. This shift in perspective allows us to engage in actions that are born of free will—not coerced by external ambitions or internal compulsions.
Prayer, in this context, serves as both a means and an end. It is an exercise of free will that transcends the immediate fulfillment of desires. 
**The Will and Free Will in Prayer**
Human beings possess free will, though often, it appears limited or weakened by various desires, pain, guilt, and other emotional barriers. Exercising free will, much like exercising a muscle, requires consistent effort. The more we engage our will, the stronger it becomes. Prayer offers a unique platform for this exercise, allowing us to engage our free will without the pressure to fulfill specific desires or ambitions.
Prayer is the only action wherein freedom is total. It is not coerced or manipulated by external pressures. Even if one begins to pray out of despair—a cornered response when all other avenues of help fall short—it remains a voluntary act and therefore fosters true freedom of will. Hence, prayer is not just a last resort but a profound exercise of free will that fortifies atma-balam.
**The Immediate and Long-term Impact of Prayer**
Every action we take generates a result, and prayer is no exception. The act of prayer itself generates Ritapalam (fruit of the action), which manifests in two significant ways. Firstly, by exercising our free will through prayer, we immediately strengthen our inner resolve and fortify our atma-balam. Secondly, prayer produces Adrishta (unseen benefits), which can be understood as grace or Punya. This grace not only helps in controlling the hidden variables of life but also aligns our actions with the larger cosmic order, thus bringing balanced and favorable outcomes.

**The Role of Dharma in Prayer**
Conforming to dharma is seen as an essential component of a prayerful life. Dharma, in this context, ensures that our actions are righteous and aligned with the greater good. This alignment negates any possibility of double standards and establishes a uniform standard of ethical behavior. When dharma is synonymous with Ishwara, any action against dharma loses legitimacy because one cannot claim to displease God in the guise of serving Him. Essentially, adhering to dharma while engaging in prayer ensures that our actions are not only spiritually fulfilling but also ethically sound.
#### Purthakarma: The Essence of Charity and Community Support
Purthakarma involves actions that fulfill the needs of the community, society, and environment. Whether it's planting trees, providing food, or offering a place of worship, these acts of service are integral to spiritual growth. They are not just about helping others but also about enriching oneself. The essence of giving, especially in this context, lies in the joy of being able to contribute, thus enhancing one's own sense of self-worth.
In Indian culture, charity is deeply ingrained, with voluntary contributions highly emphasized. The principle that giving should be done without expecting anything in return fosters a sense of humility and spiritual richness. As the saying goes, "Give with your right hand, let your left hand not know," highlighting the importance of selfless giving.
#### Building Inner Strength Through Altruism
Acts of charity build Atma Bala, making one a 'giver' rather than a 'taker.' This shift in mindset, from feeling impoverished to recognizing the ability to give, transforms one’s inner strength. True wealth lies in the ability to give, not in material possessions. This clarity helps mitigate the power desires have over us, allowing us to make decisions aligned with Dharma.


In conclusion, the practice of prayer and living a prayerful life are not antiquated rituals but potent means to develop and discover inner strength. Atma-balam, cultivated through prayer, transforms us into Purusha—whole, complete beings who navigate life with grace, strength, and ethical integrity. As we engage in this spiritual practice, we unlock layers of inner potential, fostering a life that is balanced, fulfilled, and resilient.
