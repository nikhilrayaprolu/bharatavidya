The traditional teacher-student relationship (guru-shishya parampara) is one of reverence and devotion. The guru is not just an instructor but a mentor and guide who imparts wisdom, values, and life skills. The shishya (student) respects and trusts the guru, creating a conducive environment for learning and personal growth
    
2.  Experiential Learning: Emphasizing practical experience and self-discovery over rote memorization.

Outdoor activities, nature walks, and environmental education help students develop an appreciation for the natural world and a commitment to sustainable living.

Students engage in activities that benefit society, such as helping in community kitchens, participating in environmental conservation projects, and supporting the underprivileged. This hands-on involvement instills a sense of responsibility, compassion, and the importance of contributing to the common good.

5.  Performing Arts: Music, dance, and drama are integral to Dharmic education. These arts are seen as expressions of the divine and are used to cultivate creativity, cultural appreciation, and emotional expression. Performing arts also enhance cognitive abilities and social skills.

7.  Sciences and Mathematics: The study of natural sciences and mathematics is emphasized to develop logical reasoning and analytical skills. These subjects are taught with an understanding of their interconnectedness with the spiritual and philosophical aspects of life.

8.  Values Education: Principles such as honesty, integrity, non-violence, and compassion are instilled in students through stories, discussions, and role models. These values are not just taught theoretically but are practiced and demonstrated in the school community.
    
9.  Reflective Practices: Reflection and introspection are encouraged through practices like journaling, meditation, and group discussions. These activities help students internalize values and apply them in their lives.
    

10.  Ethical Dilemmas: Students are often presented with ethical dilemmas through stories from Puranas, Itihasas and are encouraged to discuss and resolve them. This helps them develop critical thinking and moral reasoning skills.


Pedagogically, Bharata Vidya employs diverse methods including storytelling, dialogue, meditation, and service-oriented activities. These approaches aim to create a learning environment that is dynamic, inclusive, and transformative.
