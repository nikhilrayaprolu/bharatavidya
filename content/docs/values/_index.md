**Growth and Maturity in Life**

All life forms—plants, animals, and humans—experience physical growth. Humans, uniquely, also develop emotionally and mature, gaining self-awareness and self-identity. While physical growth is automatic with time, emotional growth requires understanding values, attitudes, and society. Our intellect fosters this emotional maturity.

Common sense, an inherent human trait, helps us discern right from wrong. For example, without formal education, we know not to harm or steal. This intrinsic knowledge of universal values, termed sāmānya-dharma, is fundamental to human interaction.

**Instinctive Knowledge in Animals**

Animals, like monkeys, possess instinctive knowledge. A baby monkey instinctively knows to cling to its mother, understanding the danger of falling, without needing to learn about gravity. Similarly, humans have an innate sense of right and wrong.

**Human Choice and Morality**

Humans have the ability to make choices, seeking security and pleasure through various means. The desire for money, a form of security, isn't inherently wrong. The problem often lies in the methods used to achieve these ends. Unlike animals driven by instinct, humans must consider the morality of their actions. 

Our inherent common sense guides us to avoid harm, deceit, and other negative actions, as these universally recognized values are essential for harmonious living. 

**Values and Personal Preferences**

Personal preferences, such as tastes in food or clothing, are subjective and shaped by cultural background. Universal values, however, are essential for societal harmony. For example, while personal preferences vary, everyone universally values honesty and non-harm.

**Conflicts and Compromises**

Conflicts arise when personal desires clash with universal values. Understanding the importance of universal values over personal gains leads to emotional maturity. Compromising on values for short-term gains, like lying for money, ultimately leads to inner conflict and reduced self-esteem.

**The Thinker-Doer Split**

When actions contradict beliefs, it creates internal conflict. For instance, deciding to wake up early but failing to do so can lead to self-condemnation. This split between intention and action diminishes self-worth and hampers one's ability to live harmoniously.

**Assimilating Values**

Universal values must be internalized to guide actions effortlessly. Once these values become personal, behavior aligns naturally with moral principles. Religions and cultures emphasize living in accordance with these universal values to promote a balanced and fulfilling life.
