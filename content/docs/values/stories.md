#### Stories

Storybooks of values, supported by appropriate illustrations, have traditionally been known to be a creative activity, that gives enough scope for a child's intellect and perception of right and wrong. Children world over, between the ages of five to eight, have a natural aptitude to relate to a value from a pictorial-based story.


Reading and colouring storybooks on values, supported by appropriate illustrations, have traditionally been known to be a creative activity, that gives enough scope for a child's intellect and perception of right and wrong. Children world over, between the ages of five to eight, have a natural aptitude to relate to a value from an illustrated story book.

It is to help cultivate this inborn inclination to identify with right values,  highlighting the morals and values of the legendary mythological child heroes like Kṛṣṇa, Gaṇeśa and Kārtikeya, we have the Puranas. Puranas educate children on how to live a life devoted to values such as truth, love, sacrifice, compassion etc.

Starting with the Panchatantra, it uses animal stories to teach children values like patience and friendship. Young children, who thrive on imagination and visuals, are effectively taught moral lessons through these engaging tales.

As children grow older and start questioning these stories, they develop the ability to understand abstract concepts. The Panchatantra remains an invaluable tool for imparting values through imaginative and relatable narratives.


Children learn values better when they see them embodied by divine figures. For instance, Ganesha learns compassion after realizing he hurt his mother by scratching his pet cat. Stories like these make the lessons more inspiring.


Secular values often lack inspiration. True inspiration comes from heroes and archetypes, like those in our heritage. For example, Mahatma Gandhi inspired many with his dedication to non-violence and self-sufficiency, such as spinning his own khadi. Unlike transient film heroes, our cultural stories provide lasting examples of dharma. Teaching values through inspiring stories and consistent examples can help instill them in children.


#### The Transformative Power of Storytelling in Bharata Vidya


One of storytelling's key benefits in education is its ability to engage the imagination. Stories enable children to visualize scenarios, characters, and emotions, making abstract concepts more tangible and relatable. For instance, Prince Siddhartha's journey to becoming the Buddha offers profound insights into suffering, compassion, and enlightenment in an accessible way.

Furthermore, stories act as mirrors to one's life, helping children internalize ethical principles. Characters' dilemmas in stories reflect real-life moral choices. The story of King Harishchandra teaches the virtue of truthfulness despite immense personal loss, prompting children to reflect on their values and actions.


Storytelling also fosters emotional intelligence. Experiencing characters' emotions helps children empathize with various feelings—joy, sorrow, anger, fear, and love. This emotional engagement enhances compassion and understanding, crucial for forming meaningful relationships and navigating social complexities.

Parables and allegories are particularly effective in Bharata Vidya, conveying deep spiritual and ethical teachings succinctly. The parable of the blind men and the elephant illustrates the limitations of individual perception and the need for holistic understanding, encouraging critical thinking and intellectual humility.
