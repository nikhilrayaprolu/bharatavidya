#### Mahabharata

The Mahabharata is esteemed for encompassing all human pursuits: dharma (duty), artha (wealth), kama (pleasure), and moksha (liberation). There is a saying suggesting that whatever is present in the Mahabharata is found elsewhere, and what is not, cannot be found anywhere else. This grand work is often called the "fifth Veda" due to its comprehensive nature.
The Mahabharata is a monumental poem with 100,000 verses, making it significantly longer than Western epics like the Iliad and the Odyssey combined. It is celebrated as the longest poem in existence and is written in a metrical form, emphasizing its poetic nature.
The Mahabharata, also known as the "Jaya Shastram," primarily teaches about dharma. Unlike previous eras where dharma was more straightforward, the Dwapara Yuga, in which the Mahabharata is set, depicts a more complex and nuanced view of dharma. Characters in the Mahabharata, such as Karna and Bhishma, present complex portrayals that blur the lines between dharma (righteousness) and adharma (unrighteousness).
Karna is depicted as a figure of charity and inspiration, yet his actions often support the villainous Duryodhana, creating a conflicting image. Bhishma, the grandsire of the Kuru dynasty, took a vow of celibacy and upheld his duty to the throne, yet he fought for the Kauravas, raising questions about his alignment with dharma.
Bhishma's internal conflict is illustrated when he reveals his sense of being bound by wealth (artha) rather than duty (dharma), acknowledging his predicament to Yudhishthira. Despite being bound to the Kauravas, Bhishma assists Yudhishthira by revealing the secret to defeating himâ€”bringing Shikhandi, whom Bhishma vowed not to fight.
This narrative underscores the Mahabharata's exploration of dharma's complexities in a morally ambiguous world, where even the righteous must navigate through intricate dilemmas and ethical conflicts.
