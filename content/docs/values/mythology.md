#### Mythology

The Vedic vision, preserved through Indian literature, offers a profound way of life. Texts like the Rāmāyaṇa, Mahābhārata, and the purāṇas have shaped the lives of millions, teaching them the principles of righteous living through stories rather than strict doctrines.

Education often lacks lessons on right living. Despite knowledge in science and technology, insights into ethical living are rare. Universal values like truthfulness, noninjury, and honesty can seem idealistic in today's society. However, these values are crucial, though living by them often brings conflict.

Traditional societies provided rituals and ceremonies that initiated individuals into their culture. These rites, rooted in mythic traditions, marked life's transitions and supported personal growth. Today, we need to reinterpret these traditions to fit modern contexts. For example, while ancient civilizations valued a woman's selflessness, today's society emphasizes independence and equality. Figures like Sītā from the Rāmāyaṇa need new interpretations to stay relevant.

Mythological literature serves two purposes: it models inner growth and links individuals to society. Role models like Sītā, who exemplified selflessness, were revered in their times. Today, women navigate these values within a framework of modern freedoms.

The timeless wisdom in myths helps individuals understand growth and freedom. Despite societal changes from the Satya-yuga to the Kali-yuga, human struggles and aspirations remain constant. Mythological characters, through their adventures and dramas, continue to inspire and guide us. They are kept alive through narratives, drama, dance, and other arts.

Children and adults derive different lessons from mythology. Children learn ideals like discipline and honesty, while adults interpret these values to fit modern life, aiding their inner growth and freedom.

### The Indian Epics

In the Rāmāyaṇa and Mahābhārata, divine heroes undertake epic journeys, capturing hearts with their commitment to higher ideals. These epics, or itihāsas, are grand narratives of historical heroes. The purāṇas, though not always historical, tell timeless stories of gods and goddesses, imparting everlasting values.

Teaching children these epics involves storytelling, games, quizzes, and enactments, making the learning process engaging. Plays based on the Rāmāyaṇa, Bhāgavatā Purāṇa, and Mahābhārata help bring these stories to life.

### The Need for Values

Values are the qualities that make life worthwhile. Ethical values, or dharma, are universal. To appreciate these values, one must see their worth in life. Stories from the Rāmāyaṇa, Bhāgavatā Purāṇa, and Mahābhārata introduce children to these values, fostering character development.

Ethical values like compassion, noninjury, and truthfulness are universally esteemed. Everyone values these, as common sense dictates acceptable human behavior. Values are not absolute but relative, requiring interpretation based on context. The epics provide frameworks for evaluating and living by these values.

### Value Conflicts

Value conflicts arise from opposing values, half-assimilated values, or internal moral splits. For example, the struggle between truth and monetary gain, or the difficulty in always telling the truth, highlights these conflicts. Understanding the relative nature of values helps resolve such issues.

### The Value of Values

Understanding ethics brings internal comfort and strength, crucial for a fulfilling life. Material success offers limited comfort compared to the strength derived from ethical living. Emotional maturity involves making values personal and natural. Integrity and a personal value system shape one's quality of life.

Mythology and history provide countless stories of dharma. By closely following these characters and appreciating their actions, we learn the universal nature of dharma. Living by these principles, we discover inner strength, maturity, and ultimately, happiness and freedom.
