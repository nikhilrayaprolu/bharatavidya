#### Mythology

The Vedic vision, preserved through Indian literature, offers a profound way of life. Texts like the Rāmāyaṇa, Mahābhārata, and the purāṇas have shaped the lives of millions, teaching them the principles of righteous living through stories rather than strict doctrines.

Education often lacks lessons on right living. Despite knowledge in science and technology, insights into ethical living are rare. Universal values like truthfulness, noninjury, and honesty can seem idealistic in today's society. However, these values are crucial, though living by them often brings conflict.

Traditional societies provided rituals and ceremonies that initiated individuals into their culture. These rites, rooted in mythic traditions, marked life's transitions and supported personal growth. Today, we need to reinterpret these traditions to fit modern contexts. For example, while ancient civilizations valued a woman's selflessness, today's society emphasizes independence and equality. Figures like Sītā from the Rāmāyaṇa need new interpretations to stay relevant.

Mythological literature serves two purposes: it models inner growth and links individuals to society. Role models like Sītā, who exemplified selflessness, were revered in their times. Today, women navigate these values within a framework of modern freedoms.

The timeless wisdom in myths helps individuals understand growth and freedom. Despite societal changes from the Satya-yuga to the Kali-yuga, human struggles and aspirations remain constant. Mythological characters, through their adventures and dramas, continue to inspire and guide us. They are kept alive through narratives, drama, dance, and other arts.

Children and adults derive different lessons from mythology. Children learn ideals like discipline and honesty, while adults interpret these values to fit modern life, aiding their inner growth and freedom.

### The Indian Epics

In the Rāmāyaṇa and Mahābhārata, divine heroes undertake epic journeys, capturing hearts with their commitment to higher ideals. These epics, or itihāsas, are grand narratives of historical heroes. The purāṇas, though not always historical, tell timeless stories of gods and goddesses, imparting everlasting values.

Teaching children these epics involves storytelling, games, quizzes, and enactments, making the learning process engaging. Plays based on the Rāmāyaṇa, Bhāgavatā Purāṇa, and Mahābhārata help bring these stories to life.

### The Need for Values

Values are the qualities that make life worthwhile. Ethical values, or dharma, are universal. To appreciate these values, one must see their worth in life. Stories from the Rāmāyaṇa, Bhāgavatā Purāṇa, and Mahābhārata introduce children to these values, fostering character development.

Ethical values like compassion, noninjury, and truthfulness are universally esteemed. Everyone values these, as common sense dictates acceptable human behavior. Values are not absolute but relative, requiring interpretation based on context. The epics provide frameworks for evaluating and living by these values.

### Value Conflicts

Value conflicts arise from opposing values, half-assimilated values, or internal moral splits. For example, the struggle between truth and monetary gain, or the difficulty in always telling the truth, highlights these conflicts. Understanding the relative nature of values helps resolve such issues.

### The Value of Values

Understanding ethics brings internal comfort and strength, crucial for a fulfilling life. Material success offers limited comfort compared to the strength derived from ethical living. Emotional maturity involves making values personal and natural. Integrity and a personal value system shape one's quality of life.

Mythology and history provide countless stories of dharma. By closely following these characters and appreciating their actions, we learn the universal nature of dharma. Living by these principles, we discover inner strength, maturity, and ultimately, happiness and freedom.

### Ramayana

In the Ramayana, Sri Rama is revered as the embodiment of dharma (righteousness). When Valmiki asks who embodies virtues, valor, and dharma, Narada unequivocally answers, "Sri Rama." While dharma is central to the Ramayana, the epic also explores the nine rasas (emotions) like sringara (romance), veeryam (heroism), and bhayanaka (fear).

  
Kaikeyi’s actions, driven by jealousy, create the conflict central to the story. Despite her negative role, her actions set the stage for Rama's adventures and ultimate victory over Ravana. The Ramayana teaches us about the complexity of dharma and the conflicts it can cause, even among virtuous individuals.


For example, Rama adheres to his father's promise to Kaikeyi and chooses exile, despite Bharata’s plea for him to return and rule Ayodhya. Bharata argues that dharma dictates the eldest son should rule, but Rama insists on honoring his vow. This conflict between two dharmic duties—Rama’s vow and Bharata’s rightful rule—illustrates the nuanced nature of dharma.
  

Rama’s adherence to dharma is also reflected in his treatment of Kaikeyi. Despite her betrayal, he respects her as his mother and seeks her blessings upon his return. This act highlights his forgiveness and the value of kshama (forgiveness), which is essential for upholding dharma.


#### Mahabharata

The Mahabharata is esteemed for encompassing all human pursuits: dharma (duty), artha (wealth), kama (pleasure), and moksha (liberation). There is a saying suggesting that whatever is present in the Mahabharata is found elsewhere, and what is not, cannot be found anywhere else. This grand work is often called the "fifth Veda" due to its comprehensive nature.

The Mahabharata is a monumental poem with 100,000 verses, making it significantly longer than Western epics like the Iliad and the Odyssey combined. It is celebrated as the longest poem in existence and is written in a metrical form, emphasizing its poetic nature.
The Mahabharata, also known as the "Jaya Shastram," primarily teaches about dharma. Unlike previous eras where dharma was more straightforward, the Dwapara Yuga, in which the Mahabharata is set, depicts a more complex and nuanced view of dharma. Characters in the Mahabharata, such as Karna and Bhishma, present complex portrayals that blur the lines between dharma (righteousness) and adharma (unrighteousness).

Karna is depicted as a figure of charity and inspiration, yet his actions often support the villainous Duryodhana, creating a conflicting image. Bhishma, the grandsire of the Kuru dynasty, took a vow of celibacy and upheld his duty to the throne, yet he fought for the Kauravas, raising questions about his alignment with dharma.

Bhishma's internal conflict is illustrated when he reveals his sense of being bound by wealth (artha) rather than duty (dharma), acknowledging his predicament to Yudhishthira. Despite being bound to the Kauravas, Bhishma assists Yudhishthira by revealing the secret to defeating him—bringing Shikhandi, whom Bhishma vowed not to fight.

This narrative underscores the Mahabharata's exploration of dharma's complexities in a morally ambiguous world, where even the righteous must navigate through intricate dilemmas and ethical conflicts.
