### 7.6 The Concept of God – Isvara


#### Introduction
In this sub-module, we will explore the concept of God as traditionally understood and examine why this understanding needs to evolve. We'll present logical reasons why creation cannot be separate from God, delve into the various orders in creation, and discover how a deeper understanding of God can alleviate our sense of helplessness and suffering.

### The Concept of God

#### Transforming Our Concept of God
Traditionally, God is seen as an omniscient, infallible being who dispenses blessings and punishments and must be appeased through rites and rituals. This primitive view was sufficient for simpler times but falls short in addressing the complexities of modern life. 

Understanding God’s infallibility does not mean expecting all our wishes to be granted. It means recognizing a higher order beyond our desires. The notion of God seated in heaven raises questions about the nature of divine creation and existence, challenging the very foundation of traditional theology.

#### Vedanta: God and Creation Are One
Vedanta, one of the ancient philosophical traditions of India, presents a unique perspective on the relationship between God and the universe. According to Vedanta, the universe, or Jagat, is not separate from God but is an integral part of the divine existence.

The term "Jagat" refers to the continuous cycle of birth, growth, decay, and death that characterizes the material world. This cyclical nature implies that anything bound by time is subject to change and transformation. Vedanta suggests that this ever-changing universe is not distinct from God but is a manifestation of the divine.

Vedanta proposes that space itself, which encompasses the entire universe, is not separate from God. This understanding leads to the conclusion that God and the universe are essentially one and the same. The divine presence permeates every aspect of the universe, and the universe is a manifestation of God's existence.

To simplify, Vedanta teaches that the universe is not a separate entity from God but is an integral part of the divine reality. The ever-changing nature of the universe is a reflection of the divine play, or Lila, of God. The creator and the creation are not two separate entities but are one and the same, with God being the ultimate reality that underlies all existence.

This concept might be challenging to grasp at first, as it differs from the common notion of God being a separate, external entity. However, Vedanta invites us to expand our understanding of God and the universe, recognizing the divine presence in every aspect of creation and acknowledging the fundamental unity between the creator and the created.

#### The Intelligent Design of the Universe
Take the analogy of a watch: a watch's intricate design implies a designer. Similarly, the complexity and order of the universe, from a spider’s web to the human body, indicate an underlying intelligence. Everything we see reflects an intelligent assembly, a manifestation of all-encompassing knowledge and skill.

### Understanding Isvara

#### Isvara: The Intelligent Creator
In this intricate setup called Jagat, there is no particular individual responsible for creation; rather, it is an intelligent process. Creation implies a creator with comprehensive knowledge, a being with the knowledge of everything within the Jagat. This being is Isvara, or God, not confined by location or gender.

#### The Material of Creation
If there is a creator, then what material did Isvara use to create the world? Some theologies claim that God created the world from nothing, a concept that defies reason. Vedanta teaches that the material of creation is not separate from Isvara. God is both the intelligent and material cause of the universe.

#### The Universe: A Manifestation, Not a Creation
Vedanta's description of Isvara as Sarva-Vyapin, the all-pervasive one, can be better understood through the analogy of a dream and the dreamer. This analogy helps to illustrate the concept of manifestation, where the world is seen as an expression of Isvara, who is both the maker and the material.

In a dream, the dreamer is the creator of the entire dream world. The dreamer's mind manifests various objects, people, and experiences within the dream. The dream world is not separate from the dreamer; it is an expression of the dreamer's consciousness. The dreamer is present in every aspect of the dream, permeating the entire dream space.

Similarly, according to Vedanta, Isvara is the dreamer of the universe. The entire cosmos is a manifestation of Isvara's consciousness. Just as the dream world is not separate from the dreamer, the universe is not separate from Isvara. Isvara is the source and the substance of all creation.

In a dream, the dreamer is not confined to any particular object or character within the dream. The dreamer is the substratum, the underlying reality, that supports and pervades the entire dream experience. Similarly, Isvara is not limited to any specific form or entity within the universe. Isvara is the all-pervasive reality that underlies and permeates every aspect of creation.

Furthermore, just as the dreamer is unaffected by the events and experiences within the dream, Isvara remains untouched by the changes and transformations that occur in the universe. The dreamer's true nature remains constant and unchanging, even as the dream world undergoes various modifications. Similarly, Isvara's essential nature remains unaltered, even as the universe undergoes the continuous cycle of birth, growth, decay, and death.

This analogy of the dream and the dreamer helps to clarify the Vedantic understanding of Isvara as Sarva-Vyapin, the all-pervasive one. It emphasizes that the universe is a manifestation of Isvara's consciousness, just as a dream is a manifestation of the dreamer's mind. It also highlights the non-dual relationship between Isvara and the universe, where the creator and the creation are not separate entities but are essentially one and the same.

### The Orders of Creation

#### Isvara as Physical, Biological, and Psychological Order
Isvara manifests in various orders:

- **Physical Order:** The physical universe, governed by physics, reflects Isvara's knowledge. 
- **Biological Order:** Life forms, from unicellular organisms to complex beings, are manifestations of Isvara.
- **Physiological Order:** Prana, the source of life energy, operates within every living being, indicating Isvara's presence.
- **Psychological Order:** Human emotions and behaviors, governed by psychological principles, reflect Isvara's intricate design.
- **Cognitive Order:** Our capacity for discrimination, memory, and rationality is part of the cognitive order, another manifestation of Isvara.

#### The Total Order: Unity in Diversity
All these orders are interconnected, forming a single, comprehensive order. There is no separation between the physical, biological, physiological, psychological, and cognitive orders. Understanding this unity helps us see that we are always within Isvara, never apart from Him.

### Dharma and Karma

#### The Dharmic Order
Human free will necessitates understanding what is appropriate and inappropriate in any situation. This knowledge, known as Dharma, is Isvara's manifestation. Conforming to Dharma results in positive outcomes, while violating it leads to suffering.

#### Karma: Actions and Consequences
Isvara is manifest as both Dharma and Karma. Actions in line with Dharma produce Punya (good karma), while actions against Dharma produce Papa (bad karma). This law of Karma is Isvara's way of maintaining order.

### Om: The Symbol of Isvara

#### The Significance of Om
Om is a sound symbol representing Isvara. Phonetically, it encompasses all sounds, indicating all names and forms. Thus, Om symbolizes the totality of Isvara.

### Relaxing in the Awareness of Isvara

#### Trusting the Infallible Order
Recognizing that Isvara is the infallible order allows us to relax and trust in the natural order of things. This understanding restores our sense of security and alleviates feelings of helplessness.

### Conclusion: The Vision of Isvara
Realizing that everything is Isvara transforms our perspective, allowing us to see the world as an intelligent assembly serving a divine purpose. This vision helps us trust in the order of the universe and find peace in the knowledge that we are always within Isvara.

This profound understanding resolves our existential dilemmas, offering a path to inner peace and contentment.
