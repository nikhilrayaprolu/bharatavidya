Those concerned about competitiveness may argue:

- The "real world" can be highly competitive, especially in certain career paths and industries. Students without exposure to competition may struggle to adapt.

- Competitive environments can build resilience, drive, and the ability to perform under pressure - skills valuable in many areas of life.

- Some level of competition is inherent in many systems (college admissions, job markets, etc.). Not preparing students for this reality could put them at a disadvantage.

Proponents of the Dharma-based approach might counter:

- True wellbeing comes from inner peace and wisdom, not external achievements or "winning" in competitive systems.

- Cooperation and compassion are equally, if not more important than competition for both individual and societal flourishing.

- Students can develop confidence, skills and resilience through other means besides competition.

- The goal should be to change societal systems to be less ruthlessly competitive, not to force children to adapt to potentially harmful paradigms.
